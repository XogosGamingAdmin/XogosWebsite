**Algebra I**

**Problem 1: Calculating Tax Revenue**

The British government imposed a tax on tea sold in the colonies. Suppose the total tax collected was represented by the equation: T=2x+50 where T is the total tax in dollars, and x is the number of tea chests sold.

**Question:** If the British collected $450 in total tax revenue, how many tea chests (x) were sold?

** **

**Solution:** Substitute T=450 into the equation:    450=2x+50

Solve for x: 450 – 50 = 2x                     400=2x            x = 400/2                     x = 200

**Answer:** The British sold **200 tea chests**.

 

**Problem 2: Troop Movement**

During the Revolutionary War, a commander estimated that the distance (d) his troops could march was given by the equation: d = 5h − 10 where d is the distance in miles and h is the number of hours marched.

**Question:** If the troops marched for 8 hours, how far did they travel?

** **

**Solution: **Substitute h = 8 into the equation:                   d=5(8)−10d=40−10d=30

**Answer:** The troops marched **30 miles** in 8 hours.

 

 

**Geometry Math**** **

**Problem 1: Designing a Fort**

A fort during the Revolutionary War is designed in the shape of a regular pentagon. Each side of the pentagon measures **50 feet**.

**Question:** What is the perimeter of the fort?

** **

**Solution: **The perimeter of a regular polygon is calculated as:

Perimeter = Number of sides × Length of each side

For a pentagon, the number of sides is 5:            Perimeter = 5 × 50 = 250 feet

**Answer: **The perimeter of the fort is **250 feet**.

 

**Problem 2: Cannon Placement on a Circular Battlefield**

Cannons are placed at equal intervals around a circular battlefield with a circumference of **600 feet**. If **6 cannons** are placed, how far apart are the cannons?

**Question:** What is the distance between each cannon?

** **

**Solution:** The distance between each cannon is calculated by dividing the circumference by the number of cannons:                                                Distance = Circumference/Number of cannons

Distance = 600/6 = 100 feet

**Answer:** The cannons are placed **100 feet apart**.

 

**Trigonometry Math**** **

**Problem 1: Angle of a Cannon’s Trajectory**

During a battle, a cannonball is fired at an angle of **45°** from the ground with an initial velocity of **200 m/s**. The horizontal distance (d) traveled by the cannonball can be calculated using the formula:

d = v2sin(2θ)g

where:

- v = 200 m/s (initial velocity),

- θ = 45∘ (angle of launch),

- g = 9.8 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity), and

- sin(90∘) = 1.

**Question:** How far does the cannonball travel horizontally before hitting the ground?

** **

**Solution: **Substitute the known values into the formula:

d = ((200)2 sin(90∘))/9.8                        d = (40000 × 1)/9.8                   d ≈ 4081.63 meter

**Answer:** The cannonball travels approximately **4,081.63 meters**.

 

**Problem 2: Flagpole Height Using Trigonometry**

A surveyor measures the angle of elevation to the top of a flagpole at **30°** from a point **50 feet** away from its base.

**Question:**What is the height of the flagpole?

** **

**Solution:**Use the tangent function:

tan(θ)=opposite/adjacent                       tan(30∘) = height/50

From a trigonometric table,                   tan(30∘) = √3/3 ≈ 0.577                         0.577 = height/50

Solve for height:                                   height = 0.577 × 50 ≈ 28.85 feet

**Answer:** The height of the flagpole is approximately **28.85 feet**.

 

 

**Algebra II**

**Problem 1: Modeling Population Growth**

During the 18th century, the population of a colonial town grew according to the exponential growth formula: P(t)=P0ert 

where:

- P0 = 2,000 (initial population),

- r = 0.03 (growth rate per year),

- t is the time in years.

**Question:** What will the population of the town be after 5 years?

** **

**Solution: **Substitute P0 = 2000, r = 0.03, and t = 5 into the formula:

P(5) = 2000e0.03⋅5                       P(5) = 2000e0.15

Using e0.15 ≈ 1.1618:                             P(5) = 2000 × 1.1618 ≈ 2323.6

**Answer:** The population will be approximately **2,324** after 5 years.

 

**Problem 2: Solving a System of Equations**

A colonial blacksmith makes two types of products: horseshoes and nails. The blacksmith earns **$5 per horseshoe** and **$0.10 per nail**. In one week, the blacksmith made a total of **$200**, producing **150 items** in total.

**Question:** How many horseshoes and nails did the blacksmith produce?

**Solution:** Let x represent the number of horseshoes and y represent the number of nails.Set up the system of equations:

- x + y = 150 (total items)

- 5x + 0.10 y =200 (total earnings)

Solve the system:From the first equation, y = 150 – x.Substitute y = 150 – x into the second equation:             5x + 0.10(150 − x) = 200                      

5x + 15 − 0.10x = 200                                                   4.9x + 15 = 200 4.9     

x = 185                                                                         x=185/4.9 ≈ 37.76 ≈ 38 horseshoes

Substitute x = 38 into y = 150 – x:

y = 150 – 38 = 112 nails

**Answer: **The blacksmith produced **38 horseshoes** and **112 nails**.

 

 

**Calculus Math**

**Problem 1: Rate of Change of Troop Movement**

During a campaign, troops are advancing along a straight path, and their position is modeled by the function:                                                        s(t) = 5t2 − 20t + 100

where s(t) is the position of the troops (in miles) after t hours.

**Question:**

- What is the velocity of the troops at any time t?

- What is their velocity after 3 hours?

** **

**Solution:**

- The velocity is the derivative of the position function:

v(t) = ds/dt = d/dt (5t2 − 20t + 100)                                 v(t) = 10t – 20

- Substitute t=3 into v(t):             v(3) = 10(3) – 20 = 30 – 20 = 10 miles per hour

**Answer:** The velocity function is v(t) = 10t – 20. After 3 hours, the velocity is **10 miles per hour**.

 

**Problem 2: Maximizing Cannon Range**

The height of a cannonball fired during the Revolutionary War is modeled by the function:

h(t)= −16t2 + 64t + 100 where h(t) is the height of the cannonball (in feet) at time t seconds.

**Question:**

- At what time does the cannonball reach its maximum height?

- What is the maximum height?

** **

**Solution:**

- The maximum height occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The formula for the time at the vertex is:                                  t = −b/2a ​

Here, a = −16 and b=64:            t= −(64/2(−16)) = 64/32 = 2 seconds

- Substitute t=2t = 2t=2 into h(t)h(t)h(t) to find the maximum height:

h(2) = −16(2)2 + 64(2) + 100           h(2) = −16(4) + 128 + 100              h(2) = -64 + 128 + 100 = 164 feet

**Answer:** The cannonball reaches its maximum height of **164 feet** at **2 seconds**.
