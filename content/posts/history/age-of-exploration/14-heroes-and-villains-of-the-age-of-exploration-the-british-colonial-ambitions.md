**My Name is Sebastian Cabot: Navigator and Explorer**

I was born around the year 1474, the son of John Cabot, a man whose voyages across the Atlantic opened the way for England’s claims in the New World. My childhood was shaped by his dreams of exploration and the stories of distant lands. From an early age, I was drawn to the sea, to charts, and to the mysteries of what lay beyond the horizon. My father’s expeditions stirred the imagination of Europe, and I longed to follow in his wake, though my own path would prove both challenging and uncertain.

** **

**Following in My Father’s Wake**

When my father’s great voyage of 1497 brought him to the coasts of North America, he set England’s eyes upon new lands. After his death, much of the responsibility for continuing those ambitions fell to me. I sought to make good on his discoveries and to strengthen England’s place in the competition against Spain and Portugal. Though I had the passion, my career was marked by changing loyalties and difficult choices, as I offered my services not only to England but also to Spain.

** **

**Service to Spain**

I spent many years in the service of Spain, working as a pilot and mapmaker. The Spanish valued my knowledge, and in 1512 I was appointed Pilot Major, the head of navigation for the Spanish crown. My task was to oversee voyages, train navigators, and ensure Spain’s fleets were guided with precision. In 1526, I commanded an expedition to South America, sailing to the Río de la Plata. There I hoped to find riches, but the journey turned to hardship. We struggled with disease, rebellion, and failure. My dreams of conquest did not bear the fruit I had hoped for, and I returned in disgrace, though still a man of knowledge and skill.

** **

**Return to England**

In my later years, I once more offered myself to England. The old dreams of finding a northern route to Asia still lingered. I promoted the idea of a Northwest Passage, believing that England could discover a shorter route to the riches of the East. Though my proposals were ambitious, they were never fully realized in my lifetime. Yet I stirred interest, and my ideas helped keep alive the vision of English exploration that would later flourish under Queen Elizabeth.

** **

**Final Years and Legacy**

I died in 1557, an old man whose life had been marked by voyages, maps, and restless ambition. Some call me a man of half-measures, for I often served two masters and never achieved the fame of Columbus or Magellan. Yet I see myself as a bridge between my father’s bold beginning and the later triumphs of Drake and Raleigh. I carried forward the spark of discovery, and though my own voyages faltered, I inspired others to dream of what England could become upon the seas. My life was not one of glory, but of persistence, and persistence, in time, helped lay the foundations for England’s empire.

 

 

**The Aftermath of John Cabot’s Voyages – Told by Sebastian Cabot**

When my father, John Cabot, sailed west in 1497 under the commission of King Henry VII, he reached the shores of a new land, far across the Atlantic. Though he believed he had found a route to Asia, what he discovered was the edge of a continent unknown to most Europeans. His return to England stirred great excitement. The court, merchants, and sailors all dreamed that England might now stand alongside Spain and Portugal, who had already claimed vast riches overseas. My father’s voyage was brief and his life ended soon after, but the spark he lit in England did not fade.

** **

**My Attempts to Continue His Work**

As his son, I felt it was my duty to continue what he had begun. I took to the seas myself, seeking to follow his path and to find what he had left unfinished. I believed, as he had, that a northern route across the Atlantic might lead us to Asia, to the spices and treasures so desired in Europe. Though my voyages were filled with challenges and uncertainty, I carried the memory of his achievement with me. Each journey I made was not only for my own name, but also to prove that England’s claim to distant lands could be as strong as that of any other nation.

** **

**England’s Place Among Rivals**

In these years, Spain and Portugal stood as the masters of the seas. Their wealth from the Americas and from trade with the East gave them power over all of Europe. England, smaller in reach, could not yet compete, but my father’s discovery gave us a foothold. It showed that there were lands beyond the ocean that did not yet lie firmly under the control of Spain or Portugal. England began to see itself not only as an island nation, but as one with the right and ability to sail outward, to claim, and to challenge. Though we were slow to act, the foundation had been laid, and the rivalry with Spain and Portugal would grow ever fiercer in the years that followed.

 

 

**English Navigation and Maritime Development – Told by Sebastian Cabot**

From the days of my father’s voyages, England held tightly to the dream of reaching Asia by sailing west. We believed there must be a northern route, a passage through the cold seas that would carry us to the riches of Cathay and the Spice Islands. Unlike Spain, who sailed southward and west to the Caribbean, or Portugal, who rounded Africa to the East, England sought its own path. I myself devoted many years to this idea, convinced that a shorter and safer route could be found across the top of the world. It was not gold or conquest alone that drove me, but the belief that England’s strength would grow through trade and discovery.

** **

**The Challenges of Navigation**

Yet the seas are unforgiving. Our ships were small, the instruments of navigation still imperfect, and the maps uncertain. The northern waters were treacherous, filled with ice, storms, and bitter winds. Sailors often feared what lay beyond the horizon, for many still clung to old tales of monsters and endless seas. Each voyage risked not only the lives of men but also the wealth of those who funded the journey. Even so, we pressed on, for without risk there could be no reward. Every attempt, even if it failed, taught us more about the oceans, the winds, and the lands that lay across the Atlantic.

** **

**England’s Pursuit of New Routes**

England was determined not to be left behind while Spain and Portugal grew rich. Merchants, adventurers, and the Crown alike saw that finding new routes meant opening new markets and building new power. Though our resources were fewer than those of our rivals, we nurtured boldness and persistence. In time, our sailors became skilled navigators, learning from hardship and from every failed attempt. Even when I could not complete what I set out to do, I kept alive the hope of that passage, reminding England that opportunity still waited in the seas to the west and north. These efforts prepared the way for those who would come after me, men who would turn England from a cautious island into a seafaring power.

 

 

**My Name is Sir Thomas Gresham: Merchant and Financier**

I was born in 1519 into a family of merchants in London. My father, Sir Richard Gresham, was a man of influence in both commerce and politics, and from him I inherited not only wealth but also a sense of duty to England’s trade. From an early age, I was trained to understand the ways of business, credit, and exchange. Where others dreamed of voyages across the seas, I found my strength in the counting houses and in the markets where fortunes were made and lost.

** **

**Education and Training Abroad**My family saw the need for me to be well prepared, and I was sent to study at Cambridge before being apprenticed to the Mercers’ Company. Yet it was in Antwerp, the greatest trading center of Europe, that I gained the skills that would define my career. There I learned the complexities of finance, exchange rates, and the flow of goods that bound together the nations of Christendom. These lessons taught me how power rested not only in swords and ships but in money and trust.

** **

**Service to the Crown**

My reputation grew, and I was called upon to serve the Crown itself. Under King Edward VI, Queen Mary, and later Queen Elizabeth, I acted as the royal agent in Antwerp, securing loans and managing debts. England’s monarchs often faced financial strain, and I became their trusted broker, ensuring that credit could be found abroad when it was lacking at home. In those days, the crown’s ability to wage war or pursue trade often depended on the reliability of men like me.

** **

**Wealth and Influence**

Through careful dealings and wise investments, I became one of the wealthiest merchants in England. My role extended beyond finance into matters of diplomacy, for money and politics were always intertwined. I saw firsthand how the fortunes of merchants were tied to England’s ambitions overseas, for new markets and new colonies promised new wealth. I believed deeply that commerce was the lifeblood of empire, and that merchants were as vital to England’s future as her admirals and soldiers.

** **

**The Royal Exchange**

Perhaps my greatest legacy was the founding of the Royal Exchange in London in 1565. Modeled after the Bourse in Antwerp, it provided a meeting place where merchants could gather, trade, and conduct business with efficiency and dignity. For the first time, England had a formal center of commerce equal to those of Europe’s greatest cities. Queen Elizabeth herself honored the building with her presence, recognizing that trade was now central to the nation’s power.

** **

**Final Years and Legacy**

I died in 1579, having lived through a time when England was transforming into a rising power. My life was not spent upon the seas, yet my influence was felt there, for the financing of voyages and the growth of trade all passed through the hands of men like me. I gave England an institution that endured for centuries, and I showed that wealth and stability at home were as vital as courage abroad. Though remembered as a merchant and financier, I like to think of myself as a builder of England’s strength, laying foundations of commerce upon which her empire would rise.

 

 

**The Rise of English Merchant Power – Told by Sir Thomas Gresham**

In my time, the strength of England was not measured only by armies or fleets, but by the wealth and daring of her merchants. London, already a bustling center of trade, became the heart of this power. Merchants pooled resources to finance voyages across seas, ventures too costly for a single man to undertake. Where kings and queens sought to expand their realms, merchants sought profit, and together these desires intertwined. The risks were immense, but so too were the rewards, for each voyage promised new markets, new goods, and the chance to rival the fortunes of Spain and Portugal.

** **

**The Birth of Trading Companies**

Out of these ambitions grew something new—the chartered trading company. Groups of merchants bound themselves together, securing royal approval to act as one body in pursuing trade abroad. The Muscovy Company, trading with Russia, was among the first. Others followed, each representing the combined strength of men who understood that shared risk could bring greater gain. These companies were not only economic ventures; they were instruments of statecraft. Through them, England extended her influence, making commerce the spearhead of her colonial ambitions.

** **

**Commerce and the Colonial Vision**

It must be understood that merchants and colonists were bound by the same thread. Colonies promised markets for English goods and sources for raw materials. Trade gave merchants wealth, and that wealth, in turn, financed new ventures across the seas. Every loan, every investment, every shipment of wool or cloth was part of a greater design. England could not hope to rival her continental neighbors by sword alone; it was through commerce that she would grow strong. In building the Royal Exchange, I sought to give London a place equal to the great markets of Europe, for I knew that in the halls of trade, as much as on the decks of ships, England’s empire was being born.

 

 

**The Competition Among Englishmen – Told by Sir Thomas Gresham**

In the days when England first looked outward to the seas, we were not united under a single vision. Merchants sought profit, nobles sought glory, and adventurers sought recognition. Each group pressed its own cause before the Crown, and in that pressing, rivalry was constant. Though we spoke often of national purpose, the truth was that personal ambition too often overshadowed common endeavor.

** **

**Merchants Against Nobles**

As a merchant myself, I saw how often our interests clashed with those of the nobility. Merchants wanted steady profits through trade and organized companies, while nobles looked for grand ventures that promised quick fortune or fame. They sought the Queen’s favor to fund their expeditions, even when the risks were far greater than the returns. To us merchants, such ventures seemed reckless, yet to them, they were paths to honor. The court became a place where these visions wrestled for supremacy.

** **

**Adventurers and Rival Claims**

Adventurers, bold and restless, added yet another layer of competition. Many of them appealed directly to the Crown, seeking charters that gave them monopoly over vast territories they had barely seen. One man’s claim often undermined another’s, and disputes over rights to trade or to settle were common. Instead of pooling resources, England too often saw its energies divided among competing parties, each striving for its own advantage.

** **

**The Struggle for Royal Favor**

At the heart of it all was the favor of the monarch. The Queen’s support meant access to ships, money, and protection from rivals. Thus, merchants, nobles, and adventurers alike vied for her ear. Flattery, promises, and propaganda filled the court, each voice trying to outshout the other. I myself worked tirelessly to secure recognition for the needs of commerce, reminding the Crown that wealth and stability came not from one man’s glory but from the strength of the realm’s trade.

** **

**The Cost of Division**

This competition was not without consequence. Some ventures failed because too many hands sought to guide them, while others never began because rival claims canceled one another out. Yet, from this rivalry, lessons were learned. The need for greater unity led to stronger institutions, like chartered companies, where merchants combined resources and where royal charters provided structure. In the end, though competition slowed our first steps, it forced us to create systems that would endure. From rivalry was born the order that would later allow England to rise as a true power overseas.

 

 

**The Influence of the Muscovy Company – Told by Sir Thomas Gresham**

In the middle years of the sixteenth century, England was searching for a way to join the ranks of Spain and Portugal, who had already carved out empires through trade and discovery. It was clear to us merchants that the best path forward was cooperation. Thus arose the idea of the chartered company, where a group of merchants banded together, sharing both the risks and the profits of long-distance ventures. With the blessing of the Crown, these companies gained legitimacy and protection, turning private enterprise into a matter of national strength.

** **

**Opening Trade with Russia**

The Muscovy Company was among the first of these creations, born out of the daring voyage of Richard Chancellor in 1553. When his ship reached the court of Tsar Ivan IV, England found a new and unlikely partner in trade. The Muscovy Company soon held a monopoly on commerce with Russia, exchanging English cloth and goods for furs, timber, and other valuable resources. This connection strengthened England’s place in the northern seas and gave merchants both profit and experience in managing trade with distant lands. It was proof that, even without colonies, England could build wealth through well-organized ventures.

** **

**A Foundation for Expansion**

The Muscovy Company was more than a trading body; it was a model for what was to come. By uniting merchants under a single charter, it showed how England could harness private capital for the benefit of the nation. The skills learned in managing trade with Russia—the organization of fleets, the negotiation of privileges abroad, and the handling of shared investments—would later serve us well as we turned our eyes westward. The seeds of empire were sown not only in the voyages of explorers but in the ledgers of companies like Muscovy, which taught England how to turn commerce into power.

 

 

**Financing and Risk of Overseas Ventures – Told by Sir Thomas Gresham**

**The Weight of Uncertainty**

In the years when England first looked beyond her shores, one of the greatest obstacles was not the sea itself, but the cost of venturing upon it. Ships had to be built, crews supplied, and months of provisions gathered. Such expenses were heavy, and the returns far from certain. Many expeditions ended in failure, their investors ruined by storms, disease, or the simple misfortune of not finding the riches they sought. It is no wonder that merchants and nobles alike hesitated before committing their fortunes to these uncertain undertakings.

**The Reluctance of Investors**

Merchants were cautious by nature. They dealt in wool, cloth, and goods that offered steady profit. To risk all on a voyage to lands unknown was to gamble against the very seas. Nobles, though wealthier, were equally reluctant, for a failed expedition could stain their honor and empty their coffers. I often found myself urging caution, for I knew that reckless spending could drain England of strength. Without careful planning and measured investment, even the boldest voyage would founder before it began.

**The Need for Organization**

To overcome these dangers, we sought ways to share both risk and reward. Joint ventures and companies allowed men to invest together, so that no single merchant bore the full weight of failure. Still, even these efforts were fragile, for confidence was easily shaken. A single ship lost to storm could cause men to turn away from future ventures. What we needed, and what I urged, was stronger systems of credit, trustworthy exchange, and institutions like the Royal Exchange, where trade could be organized with greater stability.

**The Lessons Learned**

Though many expeditions collapsed, their failures taught us what success would require. Careful financing, disciplined planning, and a willingness to endure losses were as vital as skillful navigation. England would not grow strong by luck alone, but by building a foundation of sound commerce to support her ventures. I saw this truth clearly: without stable financing, even the bravest explorers could not sail, and without explorers, merchants could not dream of new markets. It was only when risk was shared and managed that England’s vision of overseas expansion could take root.

 

 

**My Name is Richard Hakluyt the Elder: Promoter of Exploration and Chronicler of Voyages**

I was born around the year 1531 into a family that carried both ambition and curiosity. From my youth, I was drawn to knowledge—books, maps, and the accounts of travelers who had seen lands I could only imagine. England was still in the shadow of Spain and Portugal’s great discoveries, but I believed that our nation could also rise to prominence if only the stories of distant worlds were shared and understood.

** **

**Discovering My Purpose**

During my studies, I found myself increasingly fascinated by geography and the accounts of explorers. The world was being charted and claimed at a breathtaking pace, and I felt England must not remain idle. My gift was not in sailing ships but in gathering knowledge, encouraging others, and recording their feats. In every tale of discovery, I saw not just adventure but opportunity for trade, faith, and power.

** **

**Gathering and Preserving Knowledge**

I dedicated much of my life to collecting the stories of those who ventured abroad. Sailors, merchants, and diplomats brought back accounts of new lands, and I sought to preserve these in writing. My belief was simple: that by recording what others had seen, we could inspire a greater spirit of exploration in England. In a time when many questioned whether England could stand against Spain, I argued through these tales that we could—and we must.

** **

**The Call of Faith and Nation**

To me, the cause of exploration was not merely one of profit. I was deeply convinced that it was England’s duty to spread the Protestant faith and to challenge the dominion of Catholic Spain. I wrote not just for merchants and navigators but for statesmen, urging them to see colonization as both a spiritual mission and a safeguard for our nation’s future. In every voyage, I saw a chance to advance both religion and country.

** **

**Influence and Vision**

Though I was not as widely known as my younger cousin, Richard Hakluyt the Younger, I set the example that he would later follow. My writings, lectures, and encouragements stirred minds to imagine an England whose ships sailed far beyond Europe. I believed in the planting of colonies, the opening of trade routes, and the boldness to seize opportunities others had overlooked. In many ways, I was laying the groundwork for a vision of empire.

** **

**Later Years and Legacy**

I lived until 1591, witnessing the rise of Queen Elizabeth’s England, when exploration became a matter of national pride. Though my cousin would surpass me in fame by compiling great volumes of voyages, I take pride in having been among the first to give voice to the English spirit of discovery. My life was not upon the seas but upon the page, and through the page, I helped shape the ambitions of a nation. I may not have crossed oceans, but I carried England’s dreams across the world through words, and those words lit the fire for generations of explorers to come.

 

 

**Role of Propaganda and Visionary Writing – Told by Richard Hakluyt the Elder**

In my day, few Englishmen had ever seen the lands across the ocean, but they all hungered for tales of them. Stories of strange peoples, untold riches, and boundless lands stirred imaginations far more than dry maps or lists of goods. I understood that words could be as powerful as ships, for it was through stories that men found courage to risk their fortunes and their lives. To inspire England to venture outward, the tales of explorers had to be gathered, preserved, and shared.

** **

**Collecting the Voices of Explorers**

I made it my purpose to seek out sailors, merchants, and travelers, urging them to tell me what they had seen. Some spoke of northern seas filled with ice, others of distant markets or encounters with foreign rulers. Their words, written down and ordered, became a mirror of the wider world for those who remained at home. By collecting these accounts, I gave them permanence, ensuring that their deeds would not fade with memory but could guide and embolden the next generation of adventurers.

** **

**Shaping England’s Vision**

Yet it was not enough simply to record. The way stories were told mattered deeply. By framing them with purpose, I could turn them into instruments of persuasion. I presented voyages not as scattered adventures, but as part of a greater calling—England’s destiny to stand alongside, or even above, Spain and Portugal. Tales of hardship became proof of courage, and failures became lessons for future success. In this way, words became a form of propaganda, not in deceit, but in the shaping of vision.

** **

**Encouraging Further Ventures**

As these writings spread among courtiers, merchants, and common folk, they helped awaken a new spirit. Men of means were stirred to invest, sailors longed to test themselves upon the sea, and statesmen began to see beyond Europe’s shores. My work was not to sail the seas myself, but to ensure that the memory of those who did would serve as a call to action. England needed belief as much as it needed ships, and through stories, that belief grew into resolve.

 

 

**Religious & National Motivations for Colonization – Told by Richard Hakluyt**

In my time, faith was not merely a matter of private devotion but a cause that shaped nations. The struggle between Protestant and Catholic powers defined Europe, and it reached far beyond its borders. For us in England, newly committed to the Protestant cause, colonization was not only an opportunity for trade and land but also a means to spread our faith. Each voyage was spoken of as a chance to carry the Gospel to new peoples and to show the world that the Protestant spirit was as strong as the Catholic.

** **

**The Challenge of Spain**

Spain stood as both rival and threat, its power rooted in the wealth of its colonies and in its loyalty to Rome. To us, their empire was not only a political danger but also a spiritual one. Every Spanish fortress built, every Catholic mission planted, seemed an encroachment upon the liberty of both nations and souls. Thus, in calling for colonization, I often wrote of resisting Spain’s influence, of balancing their power overseas with our own. Colonies would serve not only commerce, but the cause of defending Protestant England against Catholic might.

** **

**Uniting Religion and Nation**

In the writings I gathered and shaped, I wove these threads together. Colonization was framed not merely as a venture for merchants or adventurers, but as a calling for the entire nation. To plant a colony was to plant both the English tongue and the Protestant faith, to carry with us the law, customs, and beliefs that set us apart. By presenting it so, I gave men a vision that touched both their purses and their consciences, so that investment in colonization became a duty to God as well as to country.

** **

**A Lasting Vision**

These arguments stirred hearts and justified risks. They gave meaning to the dangers of the sea and the hardships of settlement. In truth, faith and nation became inseparable in the rhetoric of colonization, and this union gave England the courage to challenge Spain’s dominance. Though I did not live to see all of it unfold, I know that my words helped to shape the spirit that carried England forward, binding together religion and national ambition into one enduring cause.

 

 

**My Name is Humphrey Gilbert: Soldier, Colonizer, and Visionary of Empire**

I was born in 1539 into a family of Devon gentry, raised among the rugged coasts that bred sailors and adventurers. From my youth, I was restless, drawn to tales of exploration and conquest. The world was changing, with Spain and Portugal seizing lands overseas, and I believed England too must claim its share. My education at Eton and Oxford sharpened my mind, but my heart was fixed on action and the bold pursuit of glory.

** **

**A Soldier of the Queen**

I first made my name as a soldier, serving in Ireland under Queen Elizabeth. It was there that I learned the harsh methods of war, and I became known for both my courage and my severity. My campaigns were not without controversy, for I dealt ruthlessly with resistance, convinced that firmness was the only path to order. To me, Ireland was not just a battlefield but a training ground for the greater work of colonization across the seas.

** **

**Dreams of Colonies**

More than a soldier, I was a visionary. I believed deeply in the idea of planting colonies, permanent English settlements that would extend our reach and secure our place in the New World. I wrote treatises urging the Crown to support such ventures, arguing that colonies would provide wealth, trade, and a base to challenge Spain. I spoke of spreading Protestant faith and English law, and of giving our people new lands to settle. These were not idle dreams, but plans I intended to bring to life.

** **

**Charter from the Quee**

**n**In 1578, Queen Elizabeth granted me a charter to establish colonies in North America. It was one of the first of its kind, giving me the right to claim land in her name. With this charter in hand, I prepared expeditions, though fortune did not always favor me. Financing was difficult, storms scattered ships, and some ventures never left the harbor. Yet my determination remained, for I believed England’s future rested upon these bold undertakings.

** **

**Voyage to Newfoundland**

In 1583, I finally crossed the Atlantic, leading an expedition to Newfoundland. There I formally claimed the land for England, raising our flag and declaring the Queen’s dominion. It was a symbolic moment, the first English possession in North America. Though I dreamed of planting a lasting colony, supplies were short and conditions harsh. Still, I had set the precedent, and others would follow where I had begun.

** **

**Final Voyage and Death**

On the return journey, fate dealt me a final blow. Sailing aboard the small ship Squirrel, I refused to abandon her despite warnings of her weakness. As storms raged, I was last seen sitting calmly on deck, reading a book, and calling out to those nearby, “We are as near to heaven by sea as by land.” Soon after, my ship was swallowed by the waves, and I was lost to the ocean in 1583.

** **

**Legacy and Vision**Though my life ended in failure and the colony I dreamed of did not endure, I take pride in having lit the path for others. My half-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, and men like Francis Drake would carry forward the vision I held so dearly. I believed England must be bold, must reach beyond its shores, and must plant its strength in distant lands. Though I did not live to see it, my efforts helped set the stage for the empire that was to come.

 

 

**England’s Competition with Spain and Portugal – Told by Humphrey Gilbert**

In the sixteenth century, Spain and Portugal stood as the undisputed giants of the seas. Their voyages had carried them to Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and their crowns grew rich from spices, silver, and gold. They claimed dominion over vast oceans, backed by papal decrees that sought to divide the world between them. To us in England, these claims were a challenge and an insult, for we were told that the seas were closed unless we sailed under Spanish or Portuguese leave. Their strength threatened not only our trade but our very independence.

** **

**England’s Defensive Stance**

We framed our ambitions first as a matter of defense. Spain’s growing empire gave it the means to intimidate neighbors, and many feared that England might be crushed by its power. To resist, we argued that colonies and new trade routes would balance the scales. Each voyage of discovery, each plan for settlement, was presented not as aggression but as protection for England’s survival. We told ourselves that we were securing safe harbors, securing trade, and ensuring that our people would not be at the mercy of Spain’s might.

** **

**Opportunities in Rivalry**

Yet rivalry also gave rise to opportunity. If Spain and Portugal had already stretched themselves across the globe, then their vast empires must surely leave openings. We looked to the north, where lands were yet unclaimed, and to the west, where Spain could not control every shore. By presenting colonization as both necessary defense and timely opportunity, we gave courage to investors, sailors, and statesmen alike. It was not only about resisting Spain but about seizing chances to grow our own wealth and influence.

** **

**Framing England’s Ambition**

Thus, our competition with Spain and Portugal became the language through which we explained our ambitions. We were not mere imitators; we told ourselves we were a righteous people, carrying Protestant faith and English law to lands Spain had not rightly earned. Every expedition could be seen as a blow against tyranny and a step toward freedom. In truth, we hungered for profit and power as much as they did, but by framing our actions as both defensive and just, we found the resolve to enter the struggle.

 

 

**The Role of Piracy and Privateering Before Drake – Told by Humphrey Gilbert**

Before the days of Francis Drake, our sailors were already testing the limits of what the seas would allow. England was still finding her place among the great powers, and many men sought fortune in ways that blurred the line between lawful trade and outright piracy. Ships that set out to barter for goods often returned with plunder, taken from Spanish vessels that claimed the seas as their own. To the Spaniards, our men were nothing but thieves, yet to many in England, they were bold patriots striking at a powerful rival.

** **

**The Spanish Objection**

Spain held vast wealth from her colonies, and she jealously guarded the routes that carried gold and silver back to Europe. When English ships appeared, the Spanish saw only trespassers who had no right to trade or to sail those waters. Skirmishes were common, and each clash deepened the enmity between our nations. The Spanish ambassador demanded punishment, while our sailors returned to English ports boasting of their prizes. It was a tension that could not be easily resolved, for both sides claimed the law stood with them.

** **

**Debates at Home**

These actions raised questions within England itself. Some saw privateering as necessary, a way for our smaller navy to weaken Spain while bringing wealth into the kingdom. Others feared it was reckless, drawing us toward war before we were prepared. The Crown, for its part, often looked the other way, unwilling to condemn those who brought home silver and goods, yet cautious not to provoke Spain openly. In truth, piracy and trade were two faces of the same coin, and England had not yet decided which path she would choose.

** **

**A Prelude to Greater Ventures**

Though controversial, these early raids taught us much. They revealed Spain’s vulnerability, proved the courage of our sailors, and gave England a taste of wealth that stirred greater ambition. Men like myself argued that if we were bold enough to seize what Spain claimed, then we were bold enough to plant colonies and make our own dominion overseas. Thus, piracy and privateering, though scorned by some, played their part in preparing England for the larger struggles to come. What began as scattered raids would, in time, become a strategy for empire.

 

 

**Harshness of Irish Experience as a Model for Colonization – Told by Gilbert**

**Ireland as England’s Testing Ground**

When I served the Queen in Ireland, I came to see that the struggle there was more than a local quarrel. It was a proving ground for how England would deal with those she sought to rule. The Irish resisted our authority, holding fast to their customs, their leaders, and their Catholic faith. To subdue them, harsh measures were often used, for persuasion alone seemed powerless. These campaigns revealed both the difficulty of imposing order on another people and the willingness of England to use severity when needed.

** **

**Violence and Control**

I was known, and often condemned, for my ruthless methods in Ireland. Yet I believed then, and still, that firmness was the only way to establish control. Rebellions were met with fire and sword, and mercy was rare, for mercy often bred further resistance. Plantations were established, where English settlers were placed on confiscated lands to anchor our authority. To many, this seemed cruel, but to us, it was the only way to ensure that England’s rule would endure in a hostile land.

** **

**Lessons for the New World**

What we practiced in Ireland, we soon envisioned across the Atlantic. Colonies there would face peoples who had their own ways of life, their own leaders, and little reason to welcome English authority. The experience in Ireland taught us that new settlements must be fortified, disciplined, and unyielding in the face of resistance. Just as Irish lands were seized for English planters, so too were the lands of the New World imagined as places to be claimed and settled, regardless of the will of their inhabitants.

**Foreshadowing England’s Colonies Abroad**

This harshness was not born of cruelty alone, but of fear and necessity. A weak colony, like a weak garrison in Ireland, would be destroyed by those around it. Thus, strength and severity were seen as the tools of survival. Yet in this mindset lay the seeds of future conflict, for by ruling with iron, we sowed bitterness. The treatment of Ireland became the pattern for England’s colonization overseas—firm, uncompromising, and often blind to the voices of those whose lands we claimed.

 

 

**The Idea of Planting Colonies – Told by Humphrey Gilbert**

In my youth, England’s ventures abroad were often fleeting—raids on Spanish treasure ships, trading voyages that returned as quickly as they left, or explorations that mapped coasts but left no lasting mark. I believed this was not enough. If England was to stand among the powers of Europe, we needed more than passing visits; we needed to plant ourselves in foreign soil. Raids might weaken Spain for a moment, but only colonies could secure England’s future.

** **

**My Proposals for Settlement**

I wrote and argued that the Crown should grant men like myself the right to establish permanent colonies in the New World. These would not merely be outposts for trade but communities of English families, soldiers, and workers. They would farm the land, build towns, and spread our laws and customs across the ocean. In doing so, they would serve as strongholds against Spain and bases for trade with other nations. I believed that such settlements would anchor England firmly in the New World, making us more than trespassers on seas claimed by others.

** **

**The Need for a Permanent Presence**

Temporary voyages could bring riches, but they could not secure lasting power. A colony, once planted, could grow and sustain itself. It would provide harbors for our ships, food for our sailors, and a foothold from which to explore further inland. It would also deny Spain and Portugal exclusive rights to the new lands, proving that England had both the will and the ability to endure. A permanent presence meant permanence of claim, and that permanence would make England unshakable in the New World.

** **

**Visions of English Society Abroad**

In my mind, these colonies were not only military and economic ventures, but also an extension of England herself. I imagined towns where English law ruled, where churches spread the Protestant faith, and where our language and customs shaped new generations. Colonies would relieve the crowded poor at home by giving them new land to till, and they would knit England to lands across the sea in bonds of loyalty and culture. To plant a colony was to plant England’s very identity in distant soil, and in that planting, to make England a nation of empire.

 

 

**The Indigenous Peoples and Early English Perceptions – Told by Humphrey Gilbert**

When my countrymen first heard of the peoples across the Atlantic, the tales came through the voyages of John Cabot and those who followed him. The accounts spoke of men and women who lived in lands of great abundance, clothed in ways strange to us, and governed by customs we did not understand. To many in England, these stories were filled with wonder, but also with uncertainty. The New World was not only a place of opportunity, but also a realm of mystery.

** **

**Curiosity and Imagination**

We were curious about these peoples, eager to know whether they might be allies, trading partners, or even subjects of the Crown. Some imagined them as noble and unspoiled, living in harmony with their lands, while others described them as savages, in need of the guidance of Christianity and English order. Few in England truly understood their ways, for most knowledge came secondhand through scattered reports, yet this did not stop men from shaping judgments and dreams about them.

** **

**Misunderstandings and Assumptions**

The greatest error was in believing that all peoples could be easily bent to our designs. We assumed they would welcome our goods, our faith, and our presence, yet we did not see how our arrival disrupted their lives. Many of our adventurers failed to grasp the complexity of their societies or the depth of their traditions. In truth, we often saw them through the lens of what we wished them to be, rather than as they truly were. This misunderstanding led to conflict as often as it did to trade.

** **

**The Role in England’s Ambition**

Despite the uncertainty, these early perceptions fueled England’s ambition. To the merchant, the indigenous peoples were possible partners in commerce; to the churchman, souls in need of salvation; to the soldier, obstacles to be subdued. Each account that returned from the New World fed the idea that these lands and peoples were part of England’s destiny. Curiosity and misunderstanding together drove us forward, for even when knowledge was imperfect, it gave shape to the belief that England must stake her claim among the nations beyond the sea.

 

 

**Tension Between Exploration and Domestic Needs – Told by Sir Thomas Gresham**

In my time, England was far from the wealthiest of nations. Spain drew mountains of silver from the New World, and Portugal filled its coffers with spices from the East. We, by comparison, were modest in our means, reliant on wool and cloth for much of our trade. Every crown spent by the monarchy had to be weighed carefully, for the realm’s resources were thin and easily strained. To many, the idea of spending great sums on distant voyages seemed folly when the needs of the kingdom at home were so pressing.

** **

**The Critics of Exploration**

There were voices in court and among the merchants who spoke against investing in overseas ventures. They argued that the money would be better spent improving agriculture, strengthening defenses, or caring for the poor who crowded the cities. To them, exploration was no more than gambling—risking scarce wealth on unproven hopes. Each failed voyage strengthened their case, for nothing stirs doubt more than a wasted investment. I often heard men mutter that England should stay within her island and not pretend to match Spain’s power abroad.

** **

**The Case for Risk**

Yet I believed, and still do, that without some risk, England would remain forever in the shadow of Spain and Portugal. Though we were poorer, exploration offered a chance to escape our limitations. New markets could enrich our merchants, colonies could ease the burden of poverty at home, and the flow of trade could make us less dependent on the goodwill of our rivals. To spend only on what was safe would ensure England never grew beyond her narrow shores.

** **

**Balancing Home and Abroad**

Still, the tension never vanished. Each venture abroad had to be justified against the needs of the kingdom at home. A balance was sought, though never perfectly achieved. What I urged was not reckless spending, but wise investment—ventures organized, financed with care, and guided by sound planning. In this way, money could serve both causes: strengthening the kingdom within and opening the door to a greater England beyond. It was in that balance, precarious though it was, that the seeds of our empire were planted.

 

 

**Transition from Exploration to Colonization – Told by Richard Hakluyt the Elder**

In the first years of England’s ventures across the seas, exploration was driven by curiosity and the hope of finding new routes to Asia. Men like John and Sebastian Cabot searched for a northern passage, and merchants sought to test their fortunes on unfamiliar coasts. Yet these efforts were scattered, uncertain, and often left little behind. Over time, however, a greater purpose began to emerge. Exploration was no longer seen as an end in itself, but as the first step toward something more lasting.

** **

**The Influence of Commerce**

Merchants played a great role in this shift. Through their ventures in Russia and beyond, they learned the value of organized trade and the power of chartered companies. Commerce demanded stability, and stability required more than fleeting voyages. It required bases, safe harbors, and communities that could support the traffic of goods. The pursuit of profit, when joined with national ambition, made colonization seem not only possible but necessary for England’s future prosperity.

** **

**Maritime Strength and Experience**

As our sailors grew in skill and experience, so too did our confidence. Each expedition taught us more about the winds, the oceans, and the coasts of the New World. The hardships of navigation and the challenges of distance became familiar trials, and with familiarity came mastery. England, once a lesser power at sea, was beginning to see itself as capable of matching Spain and Portugal, not merely in voyages but in establishing a true presence abroad.

** **

**The Birth of Colonization**

Thus, the age of exploration gave way to the age of colonization. No longer content with touching distant shores, England now sought to plant her people and her faith upon them. Colonies promised trade, security, and the spreading of Protestant influence. They also promised permanence, for a colony would endure where a voyage would fade. By uniting the knowledge of explorers, the wealth of merchants, and the skill of sailors, England forged a vision that would carry her into the great age of empire.

** **

**Setting the Stage for the Future**

In my writings, I sought to bind these threads together, showing how discovery, commerce, and colonization were part of a single design. I urged my countrymen to see beyond isolated voyages, to imagine instead a nation reaching across the seas. The groundwork was laid in my time, but the fruits would be seen in the age of men like Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh. Their daring would make famous what our generation prepared, turning vision into triumph and England into a power that could not be ignored.

 

 

**Legal Justifications for Overseas Possessions – Told by Cabot and Gilbert**

**The Right of Discovery – Sebastian Cabot**

From the time of my father’s voyage in 1497, England laid claim to lands across the Atlantic by the ancient principle of discovery. To sail uncharted waters and reach unknown shores was to establish a right in the eyes of Europe. My father’s voyage, carried out under the commission of King Henry VII, gave England its first legal foothold in the New World. Though Spain and Portugal disputed this, I held fast that discovery itself carried weight, for it was recognized by long custom that the first Christian nation to reach new lands could claim them for its crown.

** **

**The Papal Divisions – Sebastian Cabot**

Yet our rivals had an advantage, for the Pope had granted Spain and Portugal sweeping dominion through the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, dividing the globe between them. They claimed that this decree gave them sole rights to the seas and to the continents they encountered. But we in England rejected the notion that a single papal bull could bind the world. Our king had not consented, nor had our people been consulted. I argued that seas and lands newly found could not be the property of two nations alone, and that England’s discovery gave us as strong a claim as theirs.

** **

**Challenging Spain’s Monopoly – Humphrey Gilbert**

When I came of age, Spain had grown arrogant in its wealth and power, using these papal decrees to exclude all rivals. I wrote and spoke against such monopoly, declaring that the world was too vast to be owned by one or two crowns. Colonization, I argued, was our answer. By planting English people on foreign shores, we turned discovery into possession. It was not enough to say that John Cabot had once touched land; we must show by presence and settlement that the land belonged to us. In this way, law and action worked together to justify England’s claims.

** **

**England’s Justification – Humphrey Gilbert**

Our reasoning was framed in both law and conscience. We said that discovery gave us right, settlement gave us proof, and the spread of Protestant faith gave us purpose. Spain could not deny us without admitting their fear, nor could they hold every coast with their fleets. Thus, England justified her ambitions by turning principles into practice, blending discovery with colonization, and standing firm against the arrogance of Spain and Portugal. What began as words in charters and claims in books became, through effort and vision, the foundation of England’s empire overseas.
