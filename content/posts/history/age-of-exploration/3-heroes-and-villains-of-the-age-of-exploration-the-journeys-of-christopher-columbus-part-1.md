**My Name is Christopher Columbus: The Admiral's Journey**

I was born in the port city of Genoa in 1451, to a humble family of wool weavers. But I never felt drawn to the loom. The sea called to me from a young age. By fourteen, I was already sailing, learning the ways of wind and water aboard merchant ships. My youth was filled with storms, pirates, and distant ports—each voyage sharpening my mind and toughening my resolve. I believed from the beginning that the ocean was not a wall, but a bridge. I dreamed of reaching the East by sailing west, convinced the world was smaller than others claimed.

** **

**Maps, Myths, and an Idea**

In Portugal, where I lived for some years, I studied maps, read accounts from Marco Polo, and listened closely to sailors' tales. The riches of Asia—gold, spices, silks—were known, but the overland routes were dangerous, and the Portuguese had turned their eyes south along Africa. I was different. I believed a westward route to the Indies could be faster, safer, and more profitable. Many dismissed my idea, claiming I underestimated the size of the Earth. But I held fast to my vision, certain I could reach Cipangu and Cathay by crossing the Atlantic.

** **

**Seeking a Patron**

For years, I wandered from court to court, rejected by kings and councils. Portugal, England, even my native Genoa turned me away. I faced scorn, laughter, and closed doors. But in Spain, I found two monarchs—Queen Isabella of Castile and King Ferdinand of Aragon—who finally listened. After the fall of Granada in 1492, they agreed to fund my voyage. They gave me ships, titles, and hope. I was named Admiral of the Ocean Sea and granted the right to govern all lands I might discover.

** **

**The First Voyage**On August 3, 1492, I set sail from Palos de la Frontera with three ships: the *Niña*, the *Pinta*, and the *Santa María*. We braved the unknown, drifting west into uncharted waters. My crew grew restless. They feared we’d fall off the edge of the world. But I kept them steady. On October 12, we saw land. It was not Asia, though I believed it might be an island near it. We had reached what would later be called the Bahamas. I called the island San Salvador. The people we met were gentle and welcoming, and I named them “Indians,” believing I had reached the Indies.

** **

**New Worlds and Harsh Realities**

I made four voyages across the Atlantic, exploring the Caribbean, the coasts of Central and South America, and countless islands. I founded settlements, traded goods, and sent reports back to Spain filled with opportunity. Yet not all was noble. Conflicts with the native peoples grew. Diseases we brought spread rapidly. Some of my men mistreated the people we encountered. I tried to maintain order, but distance, ambition, and greed overtook my commands. As governor of Hispaniola, I faced rebellion and accusations of tyranny. In 1500, I was arrested and returned to Spain in chains. Though I was later freed, my titles and power were stripped away.

** **

**The Final Journey**

Still, I was not done. My fourth voyage in 1502 was perhaps the most perilous. Storms battered us. My ships rotted. I was stranded in Jamaica for over a year, begging for rescue. I never found the passage to Asia I sought. The golden kingdoms of my dreams remained distant illusions. But I had proven the oceans could be crossed, that lands unknown to Europe lay beyond the horizon.

** **

**Death and the Echo of My Name**

I died in 1506, broken by illness and disappointment, still believing I had skirted the edges of Asia. I never knew I had touched an entirely new world. Others would name it after Amerigo Vespucci, and others would conquer it in ways I never imagined. Still, I changed history. I opened the door between two worlds—forever joining Europe, Africa, and the Americas in a story of exploration, exchange, conquest, and tragedy.

 

I do not pretend that all my choices were right, or that my dreams did not come with great cost. I was a man of my time—driven by faith, ambition, and the hunger to sail beyond the map. Let history judge me as it will. I only know that I sailed west into the unknown and changed the world.

 

 

**A Dream Beyond the Horizon: My Quest to Sail West – Told by Columbus**

Before my ships ever touched the waters of the western ocean, the world as we knew it was divided into familiar paths and well-trodden routes. Asia, the source of spices, silks, and unimaginable wealth, lay far to the east. From Europe, merchants ventured overland through the Silk Road, a winding path that passed through deserts, mountains, and dangerous empires. Caravans moved slowly, and each kingdom or warlord along the way demanded their price. What reached us in the ports of Genoa or Venice came at an enormous cost. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, even the old eastern routes through Byzantium were choked off. The Ottomans held the keys to the East, and their tolls were high.

 

Spices were not a luxury to us; they were preservation and flavor, medicine and status. Pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg—these were worth more than gold. And gold itself, of course, was in short supply in Europe. We longed to trade, to grow rich, to compete with the rising powers of Islam and Asia. So kings, queens, and merchants all hungered for a faster path to the source.

** **

**The Promise of the Sea**

I was not the first to dream of finding a new way to Asia. Others looked to the sea, rounding the coast of Africa in hopes of reaching India. The Portuguese led that charge, hugging the African coastline year after year. But I looked west. I believed the Earth was round, smaller than most scholars claimed, and that Asia lay not so far beyond the Atlantic. I read the works of ancient thinkers—Ptolemy, Marco Polo, and more recent theorists like Paolo Toscanelli, who believed the oceans could be crossed.

 

I studied maps, flawed though they were, and I charted my own theories. I believed I could reach Cipangu—what you now call Japan—by crossing the Ocean Sea in just a few weeks. I imagined trading directly with the Grand Khan of Cathay. I imagined fleets returning to Spain laden with gold, pearls, spices, and silks. I saw myself as the one who could open that route and claim it for Christendom.

** **

**Doors That Would Not Open**

But believing a thing is possible and convincing others to believe it are two different struggles. I spent years wandering the courts of Europe. First Portugal, where King John rejected my idea. Then to Genoa, to Venice, to England—each court listened, smiled, and turned me away. Most scholars believed the ocean was far too wide, the distance impossible, the cost too high. Some even feared the edge of the world.

 

I was not rich. I was not noble. I was a dreamer with no ships and no crew. But I would not let go of my vision. I knew I needed royal support—someone who could fund ships, provisions, and men. I needed a nation willing to risk everything for the chance of something greater.

** **

**The Court of Castile**

I found hope in Spain. Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand were at war with the Moors, trying to reclaim Granada. I waited years while they fought. I submitted my proposal to their council, and it was rejected. They said my numbers were flawed. They said Asia lay too far. I left in despair, but I was called back.

 

In 1492, the same year Granada fell, the Queen sent for me again. She listened. She understood the possibilities. Perhaps she was moved by my words, perhaps by faith, or ambition. In the end, she said yes. They agreed to fund the voyage—not a grand fleet, but three ships. The *Niña*, the *Pinta*, and the *Santa María*. I was named Admiral of the Ocean Sea. My dream, once dismissed and laughed at, was now real.

** **

**Setting the Course**

So it was that I sailed west in search of the East. I believed I would find the Indies. I believed I would open a new path to the riches of the world. I did not know that a continent lay between. I could not yet imagine what my voyage would begin—encounter, conquest, exchange, and transformation. But it started with an idea, one I carried alone for years, across maps, courts, and oceans.

 

I was not merely chasing gold. I was chasing the edge of the known world. I believed the sea could take us there. And I was willing to risk my life to prove it.

 

 

**My Name is Isabella of Castile: A Queen's Calling**

I was born on April 22, 1451, in Madrigal de las Altas Torres, a quiet corner of Castile where the ambitions of men echoed louder than the church bells. My father, John II of Castile, died when I was still a child, and my older half-brother Henry IV became king. Court life under him was unstable, full of whispers, betrayals, and shifting alliances. My mother shielded me as best she could, but I learned early that a crown is not given—it is claimed.

 

Though I was not expected to rule, my destiny shifted when questions arose over Henry’s heir. The nobles argued, the kingdom fractured, and I found myself a pawn in marriage games, promised to one prince, then another. But I would not be moved by politics alone.

** **

**Choosing My King**

In secret, and with boldness most found unseemly in a woman, I chose my husband—Ferdinand of Aragon. We were married in 1469 without my brother’s blessing, uniting two crowns through love and ambition. I did not marry to be ruled. Ferdinand and I were partners, co-rulers, bound by faith and purpose. Our marriage became the cornerstone of a new Spain, though it took battle to earn it.

 

When Henry died in 1474, I claimed the throne of Castile. My claim was contested, leading to the War of the Castilian Succession. I rode into war pregnant, defiant. Victory in 1479 confirmed me as queen, and with Ferdinand ruling Aragon, our dynastic union began to shape the Iberian Peninsula into one powerful kingdom.

** **

**Faith, Unity, and the Reconquista**

We ruled with a vision of one Spain—unified by faith, culture, and crown. This was the age of the Reconquista, and we were determined to complete it. For centuries, Christian and Muslim kingdoms had fought for dominance across Iberia. In 1492, after years of siege, Granada fell. I stood with pride as the last Muslim emir surrendered the keys to the Alhambra.

 

But our vision did not end at military conquest. We believed that unity required spiritual harmony. We expelled the Jews that same year—thousands forced to convert or flee. It was a decision born of fear and piety, not cruelty, though its consequences were great. Many praised our piety. Others still curse our rigidity. But I believed it necessary.

** **

**Columbus and the Opening of the World**

That same year, another momentous decision crossed my path—an Italian dreamer named Cristoforo Colombo, or Christopher Columbus. He had visited other courts before ours, mocked for his belief in reaching the Indies by sailing west. But I saw something in his eyes: fire, vision, and a strange kind of fate.

 

I hesitated. We had just finished a long war. Our coffers were strained. But I gave him my support, not just gold, but my name. I called him Admiral of the Ocean Sea. When he returned, he brought with him more than gold or spices—he brought a new world. One I had helped discover by believing.

 

Yet what followed was not all glory. Reports reached me of mistreatment of the native peoples. I sent letters ordering kindness and conversion, not slavery. I wanted souls, not slaves. But I was far away, and men are quick to ignore commands that challenge their greed.

** **

**A Queen’s Last Years**

My final years were shadowed by personal loss and political strain. My beloved daughter Isabella died in childbirth. My only son, Juan, heir to both our kingdoms, died young. The line of succession twisted in ways I could not control. I looked to my grandchildren, hoping they would carry our vision forward.

 

In my last will and testament, I reaffirmed my desire that the peoples of the Indies be treated justly, converted with love, not violence. Whether that wish was honored, I cannot say. I died in 1504, just as the world we had cracked open began to reshape itself.

** **

**The Legacy I Leave Behind**

I am remembered as a queen of strength, faith, and fire. Some call me the Catholic Monarch, others see the harshness in my hand. But I ruled with conviction. I believed that a unified, Catholic Spain would stand strong in a world divided. I was not just a wife to Ferdinand, not just a supporter of Columbus—I was a queen who made choices that echoed beyond my own lifetime.

 

Let others judge me as they will. I ruled in a world of men, and I left it changed.

 

 

**The Crown and the Compass: Why I Chose to Support Columbus – Told by Isabella**

When I took the throne of Castile in 1474, Spain was not yet one kingdom, but many. My marriage to Ferdinand of Aragon united two great realms under one purpose: to strengthen our lands, purify the faith, and restore order to a fractured Iberia. At the heart of that purpose stood the Reconquista—the long effort to reclaim our homeland from Moorish control. It was not only a military campaign but a divine mission. We believed ourselves chosen to restore Christian rule to all of Spain. That belief shaped every decision I made.

 

In 1492, after ten years of siege and war, the last Muslim stronghold of Granada fell. I received the keys of the Alhambra, and with that, the centuries-long struggle ended. But victory is not rest. With our kingdoms united and our enemies subdued, we looked outward. Spain was strong, but our rivals—Portugal, England, France—were growing. They reached for new lands, new trade routes, and new wealth. I could not let Castile fall behind.

** **

**The Arrival of Columbus**

Even as Granada smoldered in surrender, a Genoese man stood at my court with a strange idea. He proposed that the riches of the Indies could be reached not by the long route around Africa, but by sailing west across the Ocean Sea. He spoke with confidence, but his calculations were questionable. My advisors doubted him. They said the sea was too vast, that his plan was foolish. For years, I had rejected his proposals. But there was something in his persistence, in his belief that moved me. And perhaps I, too, was ready for a new vision.

 

Spain had just completed a holy war. We had expelled the Jews and sought to purify the land through one true faith. The conversion of souls had become as much a part of our mission as the collection of taxes or the defense of borders. Columbus promised more than gold—he offered the chance to spread Christianity to lands untouched by the Gospel. He envisioned not only trade but salvation. He would carry the cross to the edge of the world. That vision stirred me.

** **

**A Calculated Risk**

I agreed to support his voyage. Not because I was deceived, nor because I believed his numbers to be flawless, but because I understood what could be gained. If he failed, the loss was small. But if he succeeded—if he reached Asia or something new—we would place Spain at the center of the world. I granted him ships and men, titles and honor. I named him Admiral of the Ocean Sea and gave him the right to govern any lands he might discover. These were not careless gifts. They were instruments of empire.

 

Others scoffed. They called it a gamble. But we were a nation reborn, with God and sword in hand. The ocean was no more terrifying than the mountains of Granada or the courts of Aragon. We had risen through unity and faith. Now we would rise again through exploration.

** **

**What I Hoped For**

I wanted gold, yes. Spain needed it to fund its armies, its court, and its future. But more than gold, I wanted glory. I wanted Castile to be remembered not just as the land of warriors, but as the heart of Christendom’s renewal. If Columbus opened a new road to the East, we would trade where others only dreamed. If he found new lands, we would baptize them in our name. If he brought us peoples, we would bring them truth.

 

I was Queen of Castile, and I did not fear the horizon. I believed God had chosen Spain to carry His banner across the seas. And so, I gave my name and my treasure to the man from Genoa, and I watched his sails vanish westward into the unknown.

 

 

**The Ocean Was My Map: My Four Voyages Across the Atlantic – Told by Columbus**

When I first sailed from Palos de la Frontera on August 3, 1492, I commanded three ships: the *Santa María*, a sturdy carrack that I captained myself, and two smaller caravels, the *Pinta* and the *Niña*, under the command of Martín Alonso Pinzón and his brother Vicente. We carried around ninety men, provisions for a long and uncertain journey, and tools of navigation that were limited, but in the hands of a skilled mariner, enough—a quadrant, an astrolabe, the cross-staff, compasses, and the stars above.

 

We passed the Canary Islands and sailed west, further than most dared. For over a month, we saw only water and sky. Some of my men feared we’d never see land again. But I trusted the wind and my calculations, however imperfect. On October 12, 1492, a cry rang out from the *Pinta*—land. We had reached what I would name San Salvador, in the Bahamas. I believed I had found islands off the coast of Asia. I met the people there, gentle and curious, and called them “Indians,” still thinking I had reached the Indies.

 

We explored Cuba and Hispaniola. On Christmas Day, the *Santa María* wrecked on a reef, and with the wood we built a small settlement called La Navidad. I left behind forty men to hold our claim and returned to Spain aboard the *Niña*, battered by storms but triumphant. I had crossed the Ocean Sea.

** **

**The Second Voyage – Conquest and Colonization (1493–1496)**

When I returned to Spain, I was received with honors and fame. I brought strange objects, parrots, and tales of new peoples. Spain’s appetite for empire grew quickly. In September 1493, I sailed again, this time with a grand fleet of seventeen ships and more than 1,200 men. It was no longer exploration alone—it was colonization. Priests, soldiers, settlers, and craftsmen joined us, along with seeds, animals, and tools to build a New Spain.

 

We reached the Lesser Antilles, naming and claiming islands like Dominica and Guadeloupe. When we arrived at Hispaniola, we found La Navidad burned and my men dead. I founded a new settlement, La Isabela, and faced the harsh truth of governing. There were disputes among the settlers, hunger, and sickness. Tensions with the native people—once so friendly—began to grow. Still, I explored Cuba and Jamaica, always seeking gold, always believing I was close to Asia.

** **

**The Third Voyage – South to a Continent (1498–1500)**

I sailed again in 1498 with six ships. I split my fleet—three ships to bring supplies to Hispaniola, and three with me to seek new lands further south. The heat near the equator was unbearable, but it led us to a coast unlike the islands—lush, vast, and teeming with rivers. We had reached South America, near present-day Venezuela. I was the first European to set eyes on a continental shore in the New World, though I still believed it might be part of Asia.

 

When I returned to Hispaniola, I found the colony in disarray. Accusations flew—mismanagement, cruelty, rebellion. The settlers wrote to Spain in anger. In 1500, I was arrested by Francisco de Bobadilla, sent by the Crown to investigate. I was returned to Spain in chains. Though the Queen freed me and restored some of my honor, I would never again rule as governor.

** **

**The Fourth Voyage – Shipwreck and Struggle (1502–1504)**

I begged for one last chance—not to govern, but to find the passage to Asia I still believed existed. The Crown allowed me to sail again, though I was forbidden to stop at Hispaniola. I departed with four caravels and my son Fernando at my side. We explored the coasts of Central America—what is now Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. I believed the narrow strip of land hid the strait I was seeking. I never found it.

 

Storms battered us. One ship was lost, and the rest were so worn they barely floated. We were eventually stranded in Jamaica for over a year. I survived by convincing the local people to provide food, even predicting an eclipse to gain their trust. At last, in 1504, I was rescued and returned to Spain, old, weary, and sick.

** **

**What the Sea Gave Me**

In four voyages, I crossed the Atlantic again and again. I never reached Asia, but I opened the way to a new world, though I did not fully grasp what I had found. I charted coasts, claimed lands, met peoples whose worlds were as old as ours but unknown to us. I carried with me the cross, the flag of Castile, and a vision that the ocean could bind distant lands.

 

I died still believing I had reached the outer edges of the East. Others would follow and see further. But I, Christopher Columbus, was the one who dared to sail west into the unknown. The winds filled my sails, and the sea changed the world.

 

 

**My Name is Guacanagaríx: Cacique of the Marien**

Long before the white sails appeared on the sea, I ruled as cacique of the Marien, one of the five chiefdoms of our island, which you call Hispaniola. We called it Ayiti, Bohio, or Quisqueya—land of the high mountains, of waters and wind, of sacred forests and sunlit fields. My people, the Taíno, lived in harmony with the land. We fished the rivers, grew cassava in our conucos, danced the areíto around sacred fires, and listened to the words of the behiques, our spiritual guides. I was raised to lead with strength and generosity, for a cacique was more than a chief—he was a father to the people, a protector of peace, a speaker with the ancestors.

** **

**First Sight of the Strangers**

It was in the year of the great moon, 1492, when we first saw the strangers. Their ships came from the rising sun, moving across the ocean like giant birds. We did not know if they were gods or men. When they landed near our shores, I sent word to observe them. They were strange in dress, pale in skin, and full of restless energy. But they did not come with violence, not at first. I offered them welcome, for it is our custom to greet strangers with kindness. I gave gifts of food, cotton, and parrots. I sent them women to care for them, believing them to be lost or seeking trade.

** **

**The Wreck of the Santa María**

One of their great canoes struck the coral and was lost. The sea tore it open. My people rescued many of their men and their supplies. The strangers were grateful. Their leader, the one they called Cristóbal Colón (Columbus), seemed impressed by our generosity. I offered him land to build a settlement, and so they built a place called La Navidad. I did not know it would become a wound. I trusted him. I believed we could live in peace, that we could learn from one another.

** **

**A Hope Betrayed**

Colón left, promising to return. But when he came back, he found his men dead. I had not harmed them, yet he looked upon me with suspicion. Tensions grew between the strangers and our people. They came now with more men, more weapons, and new hungers. They spoke often of gold. They demanded tribute. When we did not meet their desires, they punished us. Some of the other caciques resisted. Caonabó, brave and fierce, struck back. But war was not my way. I believed still in diplomacy, in finding peace. Perhaps I was wrong.

** **

**The Beginning of the End**

What began with gifts became raids. What began with curiosity became conquest. Diseases we had never known spread among us. Our numbers, once great, began to vanish. The world I had known—the world of songs and canoes, of moonlight gatherings and sacred zemis—was slipping away like smoke on the wind. I tried to keep peace, but there was no peace to be found. My name became forgotten by many, though I had once stood at the very edge of history.

** **

**The Echo of My Story**

I do not know how I died, only that I faded from the stories of the new world. But I was there at the beginning. I was the first cacique to welcome the strangers. My choice was made with honor, with hope, with the values of my people. Do not judge me quickly. My heart was open, and my hands were clean. I witnessed the moment when two worlds touched—when the old way of life met the floodwaters of change.

I am Guacanagaríx, son of the island, witness to the coming of the West. Though the waves have washed away much, remember my name. I was there when the sails first broke the horizon.

 

 

**First Contact: When Our Worlds First Touched – By Guacanagarix and Columbus**

**Guacanagaríx: The Strangers from the Sea**

I stood on the shore when the sails first appeared on the horizon—great white wings gliding over the water, unlike any canoe we had ever known. My people watched with awe and fear. Were they gods, spirits, or men? They came in peace, it seemed, with gestures of greeting and hands held open. We approached cautiously, offering food, cotton, parrots, and fruit. They gave us glass beads, tiny bells, and other trinkets we had never seen. We welcomed them with gifts, as our customs teach. I, as cacique of the Marien, saw it as my duty to treat these strangers with honor. I gave them shelter, warmth, and women to care for them.

 

We understood not their language, but their gestures spoke curiosity and desire. They touched our gold ornaments and pointed excitedly. They hungered for it, though we valued it little ourselves. They wore clothing even when the sun burned down. They marveled at our bare skin, at our houses of wood and thatch. We wondered if they were lost or merely foolish, but they did not act with harm. Not yet.

** **

**Columbus: Gentle People in a Gentle Land**

When I first stepped ashore, I knew I had found something rare. The land was green, sweet-smelling, and full of birds and clear waters. The people came out to meet us, naked and unarmed, offering all they had with open hearts. They gave us food, water, and shelter, and in return, we gave them small gifts—beads, red caps, cloth. They were amazed by our ships and weapons, but showed no signs of hostility.

 

In my journal I wrote: *“They are very gentle and without knowledge of evil, nor do they murder or steal. They love their neighbors as themselves, and their speech is the sweetest and gentlest in the world.”* I believed them to be a people who, if taught the Christian faith, would become good servants of God. They were quick to learn, quick to smile. I saw in them not savages, but souls ready for salvation.

** **

**Guacanagaríx: A Friendship Offered**

Their large canoe struck the rocks. We helped rescue the men and their belongings. In return, their leader—Colón, they called him—praised our kindness. I gave him land to build a settlement, and with the wood of their broken ship, they built the place they named La Navidad. I thought our friendship sealed. I believed we could trade and learn from one another. My people saw them as curious guests, not conquerors. Some even grew fond of them. But there were things we did not understand. Their hunger for gold was strong. They asked always where more could be found. We began to wonder what they truly sought.

** **

**Columbus: Signs of Order and Hope**

I was moved by their generosity. I wrote, *“They brought us parrots, balls of cotton, spears, and many other things. They traded all they had with good will.”* They knew no iron, no writing, no horses. Yet they lived in harmony and seemed content. I imagined what Spain might do with such a land—rich in promise, open to faith. I left behind forty men in La Navidad with instructions to treat the people kindly and to explore. I trusted the friendship I had built with Guacanagaríx would endure. I believed this was the first step in bringing civilization and the light of Christ to a new world.

** **

**Guacanagaríx: A Future Unseen**

When he left, I thought he would return as a friend. I hoped our people could live side by side, as neighbors. But the men he left behind did not honor our peace. When Colón returned months later, the fort was burned and his men dead. He looked at me with suspicion, though I had not harmed them. I still hoped for peace, but something in the wind had changed. Their ships grew larger, their men grew more demanding, and the promises of friendship faded into commands. I had welcomed them. I had offered my hand. I did not know I had opened the door to something I could not control.

** **

**Two Voices, One Meeting**

Our first meeting was full of wonder, misunderstanding, and hope. I, Guacanagaríx, offered friendship. I, Columbus, believed I had found a new path for Spain and Christendom. But we saw different things. To me, they were people of the land. To him, they were subjects of a crown he carried across the sea. Our encounter was not war, but it was not peace either. It was the beginning of something neither of us fully understood. And it would change the world.

 

 

**My Name is Diego Álvarez Chanca: In the Service of Health and Discovery**

I was born in the city of Seville, though the exact year of my birth has been lost to time. What I remember clearly is my calling. From a young age, I was drawn to the study of the human body, of illness, of healing. I studied medicine and surgery with seriousness and purpose. In Spain, a learned physician was both scholar and servant, and I became known for my skills and my careful attention to detail. I treated both the wealthy and the poor. But in 1493, I was summoned to a journey unlike any I had ever imagined—not just across the land, but across the sea.

** **

**Chosen for the Second Voyage**

When Christopher Columbus returned from his first voyage, the court buzzed with excitement and wonder. He spoke of new lands, unfamiliar peoples, and great possibilities. The Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, prepared a much larger expedition to follow his path and establish a firm presence across the ocean. I was chosen to accompany this second voyage as the official physician, charged not only with treating the men, but with observing and recording anything of medicinal interest. I accepted, knowing that I would be walking into the unknown.

** **

**A Voyage into the Unknown**

In September of 1493, we set sail with a fleet of seventeen ships—far grander than the first expedition. We carried settlers, priests, livestock, seeds, weapons, and dreams of empire. The sea was rough at times, but I focused on my work, treating seasickness, injuries, and infections that spread quickly in the dampness of the lower decks. When we reached the islands of the Caribbean, I found myself in a world unlike anything I had ever imagined. The sun was fiercer, the fruits were strange and fragrant, and the people—though wary—were peaceful and strong.

** **

**Healing and Observing in the New World**

We established the settlement of La Isabela, the first European town in the New World. It was poorly located, and illness struck quickly. The heat, the humidity, the spoiled food, and the unfamiliar environment brought on fevers, stomach illnesses, and despair. I treated as best I could, using what herbs we had brought, but also learning from the native peoples. I observed their use of plants, their methods of healing, and I took note. I was not only a doctor—I became a chronicler of these lands.

** **

**Letters to Spain**

In 1494, I wrote a detailed letter to the municipal council of Seville, describing what I had seen—the landscapes, the native peoples, the food, and the conditions we faced. It was one of the first European accounts of the Americas from a scientific and medical perspective. I wrote of the pineapple, noting its sweet taste and possible health benefits. I described the climate, the challenges of colonization, and the way our people were faring. My words brought news of the New World not in the voice of a conqueror, but of a man of science.

** **

**Returning Home with Knowledge**

After my time in the Indies, I returned to Spain, bringing with me not only experiences, but a deeper understanding of the world. I resumed my medical practice, but I continued to speak and write about what I had seen. The New World was not a paradise, nor was it simply a source of gold. It was a place filled with human beings, with natural wonders, and with lessons that Europe could learn—if it was willing.

** **

**What I Leave Behind**

I was not a conqueror. I did not take up arms. I came with medicine and a pen. I tried to heal, to observe, and to understand. Others wrote of conquest and glory. I wrote of fevers, of fruits, of people who bled the same as we did. My hope is that my writings helped to humanize the lands we so quickly claimed. I do not know how many of my patients survived, or how much change my voice brought. But I stood on the edge of a new age with my satchel of herbs and my ink-stained fingers.

 

I am Diego Álvarez Chanca, physician of the Indies, chronicler of the second voyage. I followed the sails not to conquer, but to care. Let that be my legacy.

 

 

**Memory: Columbus, the Taino, and What I Witnessed – Told by Chanca**

When I, Diego Álvarez Chanca, first set foot in the New World in 1493 as the physician of Admiral Columbus’s second voyage, I expected hardship, illness, and strangeness—but I did not expect sorrow. We had departed Spain with seventeen ships, full of hope and ambition, carrying settlers, priests, animals, and seeds to build a new life across the sea. The Crown had charged us not only with discovery, but with establishing a permanent presence and spreading the Christian faith. I believed we were entering paradise. But when we reached Hispaniola, we found that the settlement of La Navidad, built from the wreckage of the *Santa María*, was gone—burned to the ground, the men left behind by the Admiral dead or vanished.

 

It was a grim return. The Taino chieftain Guacanagaríx insisted he had not been responsible and had even fought to protect the Spaniards. But suspicions lingered, tensions rose, and a dream that had begun in peace was already splintering. The Admiral grieved the loss of his men but did not strike back with blind fury. He still believed in the possibility of friendship with the Taino and took steps to reestablish good relations.

** **

**Columbus and the Taino**

I saw with my own eyes how the Admiral treated the Taino. He met regularly with their leaders, offered gifts of clothing, trinkets, and food, and tried to understand their language and customs. He built a new town, La Isabela, farther along the coast, and though the location proved poor in health and soil, it was meant as a place of peace. Columbus was firm, yes—he was a man of command—but not cruel in those early days. He believed the Taino to be gentle, worthy of protection, and capable of learning the Christian faith. He urged his men not to mistreat them, though many did not listen.

 

**Enemies from the South: The Carib Threat**

Not all the island peoples were like the Taino. Soon after our arrival, we learned of another group—the Caribs—who raided Taino villages, and most likely attached La Navidad. They took captives, and were feared among the islanders. The Taino told us of their attacks, of how they took women and children and practiced cannibalism, a word that chilled our Spanish bones. Columbus took these stories seriously. When reports came of Taino captives being held in Carib settlements, he did not hesitate to act.

 

I was present when we rescued several of these captives—young women, shaken but alive. The Admiral returned them to their villages. It was a gesture of protection, not conquest. He hoped it would show the Taino that we were not their enemy, that we could be defenders of their people, not merely guests or masters. In that moment, I believe his heart was genuine.

** **

**What I Recorded as a Physician**

In my letters to the council of Seville, I wrote not only of the health of our men—many of whom suffered from fevers and malnutrition—but also of the Taino people. I described their appearance, their customs, their foods, and their way of life. I wrote of how they responded to illness, how they used herbs and rituals to treat wounds and disease. I watched their children play, their elders lead, and their women tend to the needs of the community. These were not savages. They were human, organized, and generous.

 

I also recorded how, in spite of the Admiral’s warnings, some of our own men began to abuse the kindness of the Taino—stealing food, making demands, and stirring unrest. Columbus tried to maintain order, but he was pulled between the ambitions of settlers and the needs of diplomacy. It was a difficult balance, and I do not envy the burden he bore.

** **

**The Fragile Peace**

Columbus hoped to build alliances, not just towns. He believed that by rescuing the Taino from the Caribs, by offering gifts and showing restraint, he could build a new world guided by Spanish order and Christian faith. And in those first months, some of us believed he was succeeding. But the seeds of misunderstanding had already been planted. Greed, fear, pride—they grew quickly in foreign soil.

 

I, Diego Álvarez Chanca, saw a man torn between loyalty to his mission and compassion for a people he barely understood. I saw a people who welcomed us with open arms, and who could not yet imagine what we would become. And I saw how quickly goodwill could turn to distrust, not by command, but by carelessness.

 

The history that followed was harsh and tangled. But in those first days, there was a chance for something better. I wrote what I saw, with clear eyes and a doctor’s honesty. And I hope those words will remind the future that even in conquest, there were those who tried to protect, to heal, and to understand.

 

 

**Voices Across the Sea: Misunderstandings – By Guacanagaríx and Isabella**

**Guacanagaríx: We Greeted You With Open Hands**

When your ships came, we did not raise our weapons. We watched from the trees, from the shorelines, wondering if you were gods or spirits or simply men far from home. In our way, we responded with generosity. That is our law. A stranger must be cared for. I gave Colón food, shelter, land for his people, and women to tend to their needs. We danced for them, shared our cassava and tobacco, and offered ornaments of gold, not because we worship it, but because it is beautiful. We thought you would do the same—trade, share, teach us something new. But your men took what they wanted, asked endlessly about where to find more gold, and gave us beads and bells that meant little to us. What you saw as gifts, we saw as distractions. What you saw as land to claim, we saw as land we were lending in friendship.

** **

**Isabella: We Came With Faith and Purpose**

You must understand the world we came from. Spain had just been reborn through struggle and sacrifice. We had reclaimed our lands, united our crowns, and devoted ourselves to the glory of God. When Columbus returned and spoke of your people, he described you as kind, welcoming, and without the knowledge of our faith. I saw souls to be saved, a land where Christianity could flourish. It was our sacred duty to bring the light of truth to those who lived in darkness. If we asked where gold was found, it was not out of greed alone, but to build churches, support missions, and strengthen the Crown that had risked so much for this voyage. I commanded my subjects to treat your people with kindness, to convert with love, not cruelty. If they disobeyed, it was against my will.

** **

**Guacanagaríx: You Spoke One Language, but Acted in Another**

You say you came in peace, and perhaps your words were sincere. But the actions of your men spoke louder than promises. They cut down our trees to build forts without asking. They shouted in anger when we did not understand their commands. They wore metal and carried blades—objects we had never seen—and they displayed them not as tools, but as threats. Your people did not understand our dances, our sacred rites, or our way of greeting with open hands and shared food. They saw our lack of clothing and called us primitive. But we are not without order. We have laws, customs, elders, and gods. Did they ask? No, they assumed. And they took.

** **

**Isabella: Your Innocence Was Misread—By Both Sides**

You are right to say there was misunderstanding. It is true, our men were not all patient. They came from a world where kingdoms rise and fall in war, where survival demands strength. They mistook your openness for submission, your silence for weakness. But do not think you understood us either. When my captains asked for gold, it was because in Europe, gold is the currency of nations. When they built forts, it was because they feared being abandoned, or betrayed. Your generosity, while noble, was confusing to them. How could men give so much without a price? In our world, that does not happen. We misread each other, but our hopes were not so different—we both wished to grow strong and protect our people.

** **

**Guacanagaríx: You Measured Us Without Knowing Us**

You judged us by your own mirrors. You saw our land and believed it was unclaimed because it had no walls. You saw our people and believed they needed your gods because they did not speak Latin. You did not ask what our symbols meant, what our gods taught, or how we raised our children. You heard only the silence of your own expectations. I did not refuse friendship. I gave it freely. But your explorers measured our worth by what we lacked in their eyes—not by what we already possessed.

** **

**Isabella: And Yet We Shared a Moment of Peace**

Still, Guacanagaríx, there was a time when we stood on the edge of something new. You welcomed my captains. They returned with stories not of war, but of kindness. For a brief moment, two worlds touched without swords. That moment mattered. You were the first to meet us without fear. I believed we could build an alliance, one of faith, trade, and shared destiny. It was not a simple dream. It was a hope. And though much went wrong afterward, I remember that first encounter with gratitude.

** **

**Guacanagaríx: The Ocean Took More Than It Gave**

I, too, remember those early days. Before the hunger for gold grew sharp. Before the soldiers replaced the sailors. Before the prayers turned to commands. You believed you were bringing light, but you did not see the fires you left behind. You came with crosses, but also with chains. What began as friendship drowned in misunderstanding. And yet, I still tell our children of that first meeting—not to forget, but to remind them that we once believed peace was possible.

** **

**Two Worlds, One Beginning**

We came from opposite ends of the ocean, guided by different stars. We spoke different tongues, worshiped different gods, and saw the earth through different eyes. But in the beginning, for a brief span of days, we stood face to face with hope in our hands. If only we had listened more than we spoke, watched more than we judged, perhaps our paths might have led somewhere brighter. Let that be remembered. Let both our voices remain.

 

 

**My Name is Pedro Alonso Niño: From Africa to Europe and the Americas**

I was born around 1468 in the small port town of Moguer, in Andalusia, Spain. The sea was part of me from the beginning. My father had been a sailor, and so were my brothers. Our lives were tied to the rhythm of the tide and the pull of the stars. We fished the Atlantic, hauled cargo up and down the coast, and learned to read the sky like a book. I was of African descent—my skin marked me as different—but in the ports and ships of Andalusia, what mattered most was whether you could sail. And I could sail.

** **

**The Call of Exploration**

In 1492, I joined an expedition that would shake the world. Christopher Columbus was seeking a western route to the Indies, and I was chosen as the pilot of the *Niña*. I knew the Atlantic better than most. I had already sailed to the Canary Islands, the coast of Africa, even the reaches of Guinea. I could handle rough seas, guide a ship by moonlight, and smell land before it appeared on the horizon. We left Palos de la Frontera that August, three ships cutting into the unknown. Some thought we would never return.

** **

**Across the Ocean Sea**

The voyage was hard. The food spoiled, the crew grumbled, and the wind sometimes abandoned us. But I kept my course steady. On October 12, land was spotted. We had reached the islands now called the Bahamas. I watched as Columbus claimed the land for Spain, and we met the native people—gentle, open, and curious. We continued on to explore Cuba and Hispaniola. I helped guide the *Niña* home safely, navigating storms and broken hopes. The return journey was just as treacherous as the outbound trip, but I brought us back.

** **

**Captain of My Own Fate**

In the years after that first voyage, I continued to sail. I was a pilot again for Columbus on later expeditions, always seeking more—more land, more trade, more gold. But I did not stop there. In 1499, I led my own expedition with the blessing of the Spanish Crown. I sailed to the coasts of what is now Venezuela, exploring the Gulf of Paria. I traded with the native peoples, bringing back pearls and other goods. I reported everything faithfully to the Crown, and yet, I did not return a rich man. I was accused of hiding profits, though I had not.

** **

**My Legacy on the Sea**

I do not know what history has done with my name. Some have forgotten me or left me out of their stories. Others remember me only as a footnote to the greater tale of Columbus. But I was there—at the helm, watching the New World rise from the waves. I was one of the first African-descended men to cross the Atlantic as a free explorer, not a slave. I sailed not as a shadow, but as a guide. My knowledge helped open the door between continents.

** **

**The World I Helped Reveal**

I sailed when others feared. I navigated oceans few had dared to cross. I witnessed the beginnings of something vast and terrible and beautiful. I knew that what we had found was no edge of Asia, but something else entirely. I knew the world had changed. I was a man of the sea, and the sea remembers.

 

My name is Pedro Alonso Niño. I was born of Africa and Spain, and I carved my path across the ocean with skill and courage. I was more than a sailor. I was a witness to the turning of an age.

 

 

**The Eyes of the Ship: My Life as a Navigator – Told by Niño**

To many, the sea is a mystery—endless, restless, and unforgiving. But to me, a navigator, it is a map written in wind and stars. A navigator is not simply someone who points the way. He is the memory of the sea, the pulse of the voyage, the one who reads the sky when there is no land in sight. While the captain gives orders and the crew pulls ropes and patches sails, it is the navigator who guides the ship, who ensures that we do not drift into silence and never return.

 

I watched the sun's arc each day. I took readings with a quadrant or astrolabe, though the tools were crude and the calculations demanding. I measured time with sand and judged our speed by watching the foam trail behind the hull. At night, I read the heavens—Orion, Polaris, the Southern Cross when we reached low enough. I watched for cloud shapes, bird flights, and water color. Every detail told me something. One mistake, one misread wind, and we could be lost forever. So, I kept watch when others slept. I learned to listen to the sea as if it were speaking.

** **

**Preparing the Ships for the Journey**

When we readied ourselves to sail with Admiral Columbus in 1492, we knew this voyage would be unlike any other. We were not hugging a coastline or crossing to familiar ports. We were sailing into the unknown. Our three ships—the *Santa María*, the *Pinta*, and the *Niña*—were not great galleons but small and nimble vessels, fit for coasting and trade, not open ocean. Still, we strengthened their hulls, secured extra spars and sailcloth, loaded barrels of salted meat, hardtack, wine, and fresh water. We packed tools, weapons, and navigational instruments. We took beads and trinkets too—gifts, or trade, for whoever we might meet.

 

Every ship needed repair before departure. The *Pinta*, in particular, had trouble with her rudder. We delayed in port until we could lash it firmly, praying it would hold. Each ship required careful balance of ballast and cargo. We couldn't afford to list or drift too slow in waters we did not know. We were going not just to explore, but to survive.

** **

**Down to the Canary Islands**

From the port of Palos de la Frontera, we sailed south first, down the coast of Spain and out toward the Canary Islands. This was a common route—any sailor who knew the Atlantic knew to catch the northeasterly winds from there. But even familiar waters can test you. The sea was temperamental, and our sails groaned under pressure. The *Niña*, which I guided, held strong, but we watched the *Pinta* struggle. The rudder came loose again before we reached land. We anchored in the Canaries for repairs, staying longer than planned.

 

We waited in La Gomera, one of the islands closest to Africa. While repairs were made, we took on more water and food, patched sails, and studied the weather. I watched the sky every evening, reading wind signs and cloud shapes. This was the last land we would see. Once we left the Canaries, it would be west, into nothing. No ports. No charts. Just the sea and what lay beyond.

** **

**Why the Navigator Matters Most at Sea**

When we finally set out from La Gomera on September 6, 1492, every man on board depended on what I saw and what I believed. The Admiral held the vision, yes, and the captains kept the crew in line. But I was the one watching the stars, measuring our path. If I was wrong, we would sail off the map and into death. If I was right, we would find land where none was expected. I felt the weight of it—not as a burden, but as purpose.

 

And so we sailed west, across a vast, breathing ocean, my eyes fixed on the horizon and the heavens above, guiding our way into the pages of history. I was the navigator. Without me, we were only men afloat. With me, we became explorers.

 

 

**Across the Waters: The Beginning of the Columbian Exchange - Told by Niño**

When I first crossed the Atlantic with Admiral Columbus in 1492, as the pilot of the *Niña*, I believed I was part of a journey to find gold, spices, and glory. I did not know then that we were also carrying something far more powerful than swords or crosses. We brought with us the seeds of transformation—not just for Spain, but for the world. The moment our boots touched the sand of those bright islands, a great exchange began. Not of coins or goods, but of life itself—plants, animals, people, and unseen forces that would change both sides of the ocean forever.

** **

**What We Found Growing Under Their Sun**

In the lands of the Taino, the soil was rich and unfamiliar. They offered us foods I had never seen—sweet fruits, root vegetables, and crops we did not have in Spain. Maize, which you now call corn, was everywhere. Cassava bread was their daily meal, made from a root that looked like wood but fed like grain. They gave us peppers that burned the tongue, pineapples that burst with juice, and tobacco leaves they dried and smoked for ceremony and calm. These were gifts not only to our mouths but to our culture. I saw some men abandon their old tastes and crave the new.

 

We carried these foods back to Spain. At first, people mocked them. Then they tasted them. Then they planted them. From those first exchanges came new habits, new economies, and eventually entire empires built on crops that had never known European soil before.

** **

**What We Brought Without Meaning To**

But we did not only take—we gave. We brought wheat and barley, sugarcane and grapes. We released pigs, cattle, goats, and horses onto islands where they had never lived. Some of the animals ran wild, changing the land, devouring native plants, and altering how people hunted and farmed. The Taino had no beasts of burden, no horses for war. Our animals became weapons and tools, helping settlers shape the land but also driving away the balance the natives had lived with for generations.

 

More dangerous still were the things we carried in our blood. We brought with us diseases—smallpox, measles, influenza—that leapt from our breath to theirs. The Taino had no defense. I watched with helpless eyes as strong, joyful people grew sick in days and died in silence. Villages emptied. The laughter of children faded. It was not battle that destroyed them—it was breath. And we did not know how to stop it.

** **

**Ideas Carried on the Wind**

We shared more than food and illness. We shared beliefs. We brought our God, our priests, our books, our language. To the Taino, these were strange things, but some embraced them, hoping it would bring peace or favor. Others resisted. At the same time, we sailors and settlers learned from the natives—how to plant in their soil, how to heal wounds with herbs, how to find fresh water in the jungle. I myself took native words into my speech. Their ways of life taught us things we had not learned from all the universities of Spain.

 

But the sharing was not equal. Our ideas came with the weight of empire. Our customs arrived with chains, while theirs were too often ignored or swept aside. We dressed them in our clothes and called it dignity. We taught them our prayers and called it salvation. But we did not ask enough questions. We did not listen.

** **

**A New World Was Born**

In time, the exchange grew beyond imagination. Tomatoes, potatoes, and chocolate crossed the sea to become staples of Europe. Coffee and sugar, driven by demand, reshaped entire islands. People followed too—not just Spaniards, but enslaved Africans, forced into labor to work the crops we had once admired as gifts. This exchange, which began with curiosity, became a machine—one that fed kingdoms and broke lives.

 

I, Pedro Alonso Niño, was there when it began. I helped chart the currents, guided ships through wind and storm, and watched history spill from crates and baskets, from fields and lungs. The world you know now—the meals you eat, the animals you raise, the languages you speak—was born on those waves. We did not know the weight of what we carried. But we carried it all the same. And the world was never the same again.

 

 

**A Crown’s Burden: Why I Sent Nicolás de Ovando to the Indies – Told by Isabella**When I agreed to support Christopher Columbus’s first voyage in 1492, I believed it was a divine opportunity—a chance for Spain to claim new lands, convert new souls, and enrich the Crown with the treasures of Asia. I did not expect the voyage to succeed so quickly, nor the flood of change that would follow. The news of his discovery spread through Spain like wildfire. We granted him noble titles, honors, and the right to govern the lands he had found. At first, it seemed a glorious chapter had begun.

 

But I soon learned that new lands are not governed like old ones. And dreams of gold and glory can lead even the most faithful men astray.

** **

**The Growing Storm**

Columbus returned from his second voyage not as a triumphant governor but as a man surrounded by complaints, rebellion, and misfortune. La Isabela, the first settlement, was a failure—diseased, disordered, and constantly short of supplies. The settlers wrote to the Crown, begging for help, accusing Columbus and his brothers of misrule. Even some of the friars spoke against him. They claimed he ruled like a foreign prince, not as a servant of Castile. They said the natives were mistreated. Others said he was too lenient and had lost control. Reports contradicted each other, but all agreed on one thing: the colony was in disarray.

 

I still believed Columbus was a man of vision, but I began to question whether he was a man of government.

** **

**A Difficult Decision**

Ferdinand and I could not ignore what was happening. The Indies were not merely Columbus’s venture—they were part of our growing empire. If we allowed chaos to continue, Spain would suffer. I feared the Crown’s name would be stained, and the native peoples, whom we had sworn to convert and protect, would be lost in cruelty or lawlessness.

 

We sent Francisco de Bobadilla in 1500 to investigate and restore order. I did not expect him to arrest Columbus, but when he returned to Spain in chains, I saw before me a broken man. I wept when I saw him. He had crossed an ocean for Spain, and now he was disgraced. After hearing both sides, I ordered his release, restored his titles, and allowed him to plan a final voyage. But I knew he could never return to govern.

** **

**Why I Chose Nicolás de Ovando**

We needed a new leader—one not driven by ambition or blinded by discovery. Nicolás de Ovando was a knight of the Order of Alcántara, a man known for discipline, order, and obedience to the Crown. He was not a dreamer. He was a builder, a soldier, and a loyal servant. In 1501, I named him Governor and Captain-General of the Indies.

 

I trusted him to establish true government in the New World—to build cities, regulate the economy, protect the Church’s mission, and bring justice where confusion reigned. I sent him with the largest fleet yet dispatched to the Indies, over thirty ships and hundreds of settlers. His task was not discovery, but administration. Columbus had opened the door. Ovando was to lay the foundation.

** **

**Replacing the Admiral**

We did not remove Columbus out of hatred or betrayal. We removed him because the work had changed. The vision that launched the ships was no longer enough. What the Indies needed was structure—law, roads, churches, and ships full of gold returning safely to Seville. Ovando replaced Columbus not with ceremony, but with quiet authority. His ships arrived. His orders were read. And the Admiral, still on his final voyage, was left to sail the edges of the unknown while the colony he once governed was shaped by steadier hands.

** **

**The Cost of Empire**

In my heart, I never stopped honoring Columbus for what he achieved. But even I, Queen of Castile, could not allow loyalty to outweigh responsibility. The empire was growing. The world was watching. I chose Nicolás de Ovando not because he dreamed, but because he obeyed.

 

I am Isabella, Queen of Castile. I sent Columbus west. I sent Ovando to rule. One opened the map. The other filled it in. And in doing so, we reshaped the world, for better and for worse.
