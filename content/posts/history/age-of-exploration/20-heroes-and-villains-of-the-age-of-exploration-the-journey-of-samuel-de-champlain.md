**My Name is Henry IV of France: King of France and Navarre**

I was born in 1553 in Pau, a small town in Navarre. My childhood was shaped by the wars of religion that tore France apart between Catholics and Protestants. As a young prince, I was raised in the Protestant faith and trained in the arts of war and leadership, for my country was never at peace.

** **

**The Wars of Religion**

My life became a struggle for survival and power. I fought as a Protestant leader, but fate placed me close to the throne of France. When I became king in 1589, my crown was not secure. Civil war raged, and many sought my death. To unite France, I made the difficult decision to convert to Catholicism, for I believed the kingdom’s peace was worth more than my pride.

** **

**A King for All France**

They called me “Good King Henry” because I sought to heal the wounds of my people. I issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598, granting tolerance to Protestants and ending decades of bloodshed. I worked to rebuild France—repairing roads, improving farms, and restoring order to a land shattered by war.

** **

**Dreams of Exploration**

Peace at home gave me the freedom to look abroad. I saw how Spain and Portugal had grown rich through their colonies, and I wanted France to share in that glory. I supported voyages across the Atlantic, believing that a new France could be built in the New World. Samuel de Champlain’s efforts in Canada were born from my vision and support.

** **

**My Assassination**

Though I brought peace to France, not all were content. In 1610, as I prepared to lead my armies into war against Spain, I was struck down by an assassin’s blade in the streets of Paris. My death shocked the kingdom, for many had come to see me as the father of my people.

** **

**My Legacy**I left behind a stronger France, one that had tasted peace after years of bloodshed. I also left behind the beginnings of New France across the ocean, a colony that would carry the French name for centuries. Though my life ended violently, I am remembered as a king who put his people before himself and gave France the chance to prosper once more.

 

 

**The Dream of New France – Told by Henry IV of France**

When I became king, I saw a nation scarred by civil war and weakened compared to our rivals. Spain and Portugal had already built empires across the oceans, filling their treasuries with gold, silver, and goods from distant lands. England too was beginning to carve its place on the seas. For France to stand among the great powers, we could not remain only within our borders. We needed colonies to expand our influence, strengthen our economy, and bring honor to the crown.

** **

**Economic Ambitions**

The lure of wealth drove much of our interest. Furs, fish, timber, and new trade routes promised riches to those bold enough to seize them. Colonies would provide resources we lacked at home and give our merchants markets beyond the crowded ports of Europe. By supporting men like Champlain, I hoped to build a French presence that could rival the prosperity of Spain’s colonies.

** **

**Religious Motivations**

Religion too guided our ambitions. France had been torn apart by decades of religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants. By the time I issued the Edict of Nantes, granting tolerance to both faiths, I dreamed of uniting France under a common cause abroad. Colonies offered a place to spread the Christian faith, to bring the word of God to new peoples, and to show that France was a kingdom chosen to carry faith and civilization into unknown lands.

** **

**Champlain’s Role in the Vision**

Samuel de Champlain became the man to carry this dream across the Atlantic. His skill as a navigator, his courage as an explorer, and his loyalty to France made him the perfect agent of royal ambition. Through him, Quebec was founded, and with it the heart of New France. Each map he drew, each alliance he forged, was part of the vision I held for a French empire that would endure for generations.

** **

**The Dream Made Real**

The dream of New France was not built in a day, nor could it be secured by one voyage. It was born from determination, sacrifice, and vision. I believed France was destined to thrive not only in Europe but across the oceans. Though my reign ended by an assassin’s hand, I left behind the foundations of a new world that would carry the name of France far beyond its own shores.

 

 

**The Rivalry with England – Told by Henry IV of France**

In my reign, Europe was a battlefield not only of armies but of empires. Spain had claimed vast wealth from its colonies, and England was rising as a formidable naval power. France, though strong, risked falling behind. The seas became the new arena of competition, and North America was the prize. It was not enough to rule at home; to secure our future, France had to contest the oceans and the lands across them.

** **

**England’s Challenge**

The English sought to plant their colonies along the Atlantic coast, pushing their reach from the north toward the south. They challenged Spain on the seas and began to challenge France by venturing into the very regions we hoped to claim. Their ships patrolled waters we sought to control, and their settlers carried ambitions as great as our own. Every French step in North America risked being shadowed by an English rival.

** **

**The Importance of New France**

For me, New France was more than a distant settlement; it was the shield and spear of French ambition. Quebec, Acadia, and the fur trade routes gave France a foothold in North America. If we lost them, we would cede the continent to England and Spain. If we held them, we could rival their strength and carve a place for France in the New World.

** **

**The Contest of Power**

This rivalry was not only about land but also about faith and influence. England, with its Protestant kings, sought to extend their power and ideals. France, Catholic and loyal to Rome, brought with it another vision of society. Thus, the struggle for North America became a reflection of the conflicts within Europe itself, with colonies as extensions of the wars of faith and power that divided our continent.

** **

**The Stakes for the Future**

I knew that France could not remain idle. To stand against England, we had to plant settlements, forge alliances, and secure trade. This rivalry would not be decided in a single battle but in generations of persistence. The founding of New France was my answer to England’s challenge, a claim that France, too, would shape the destiny of the New World.

 

 

**My Name is Samuel de Champlain: Explorer and Founder of New France**

I was born in Brouage, a small port town in France, around 1574. My father was a sea captain, and from an early age I was drawn to the ocean. I learned the art of navigation, mapmaking, and the ways of the sea. These skills would become the tools that defined my life.

** **

**First Voyages Across the Atlantic**As a young man, I joined expeditions that carried me far from France. I sailed to the Caribbean and parts of South America, where I saw the power and wealth that Spain had gained from its colonies. I realized then that France too must look to the New World if it wished to prosper.

** **

**The Dream of a French Colony**

In 1603, I crossed the Atlantic again, this time to explore the St. Lawrence River. The land was vast, filled with forests, rivers, and people who lived in harmony with the land. I dreamed that France could build a new society here, one that could thrive through trade and alliance.

** **

**Founding of Quebec**

In 1608, I established Quebec on the banks of the St. Lawrence. It was not easy. The first winter claimed many lives, but the settlement endured. Quebec became the heart of New France, a place where trade, faith, and new beginnings could take root.

** **

**Alliances with Indigenous Nations**

I quickly learned that survival in this new land depended on friendship. I forged alliances with the Algonquin, Huron, and Montagnais. They taught us how to live through the winters, how to hunt, and how to navigate the wilderness. Together, we fought battles against the Iroquois, sharing both victories and losses.

** **

**Life as a Cartographer and Soldier**

Beyond being a governor and explorer, I was a mapmaker. I charted rivers and lakes that no European had seen before, including great waters that would later be known as the Great Lakes. I also stood alongside my allies in battle, believing our destinies were linked.

** **

**My Legacy**

I spent my life crossing the ocean, building Quebec, and dreaming of a colony where French and Indigenous peoples could live side by side. I never saw my dream fully realized, but I planted its roots. When I died in Quebec in 1635, I left behind more than a map or a fort—I left the beginnings of a nation.

 

 

**Early Explorations and Mapping – Told by Samuel de Champlain**

When I first crossed the Atlantic in 1603, I felt the thrill of discovery in every wave. The vastness of the new land stirred my imagination, for here were rivers and forests unknown to Europe. My task was not only to explore but to record, to make sense of this land for the crown of France. Each journey, whether to Acadia, the St. Lawrence River, or the coasts of New England, brought new knowledge to be carried home.

** **

**The Work of a Cartographer**

From my youth, I had trained my eyes to see not only beauty but detail. I measured coastlines, marked harbors, and noted the bends of rivers and the height of mountains. My maps were not merely lines on parchment; they were tools for survival, guides for sailors, and proofs to my king that the dream of New France was possible. I took pride in accuracy, for I knew others would rely on my work.

** **

**Charting the St. Lawrence**

The St. Lawrence River became the lifeline of my explorations. I traced its winding course deep into the continent, marking where villages stood and where rapids blocked the passage. I recorded not only the river itself but also the people who lived along its shores, for their lives were as much a part of the land as the waters and trees. My maps carried their presence to Europe, where few had heard their names.

** **

**The Great Lakes and Beyond**

In time, my journeys stretched even farther. Guided by allies, I reached the great inland seas that would one day be called the Great Lakes. To see such vast waters was to glimpse the true size of this continent. These discoveries gave France a claim not only to Quebec but to a whole network of rivers and lakes that connected the heart of North America.

** **

**Laying the Foundation for New France**

My explorations were never for myself alone. Each line I drew and each description I wrote became part of France’s vision for the New World. Without maps, there could be no colonies, no trade, and no hope of survival. In mapping the land, I laid the first stones of New France, a foundation upon which others would build for generations.

 

 

**My Name is Chief Membertou: Leader of the Mi’kmaq People**

I was born around 1510, long before the arrival of the French to our lands. I grew up among the Mi’kmaq, learning the ways of hunting, fishing, and guiding my people through the rhythms of the seasons. By strength, wisdom, and courage, I rose to become a sagamore, a leader respected among my nation.

** **

**First Encounters with Europeans**

When I was already an old man, the French came to our shores. I had lived more than seventy winters by then, yet I still carried the strength to guide my people. I met Samuel de Champlain and others who sought trade and friendship. I chose to welcome them, for I saw the advantages that alliance could bring.

** **

**Building Alliances**

I believed that peace with the French could secure the future of my people. We shared with them food and knowledge of the land, and in return they brought goods and weapons that changed our way of life. Together, we defended against rival nations who threatened us.

** **

**My Baptism**

In 1610, I chose to embrace the Christian faith. I was baptized with my family, becoming the first Mi’kmaq leader to do so. I saw this not only as a spiritual act but also as a way to strengthen ties with the French, to show that our peoples could walk a shared path.

** **

**Leader and Warrior**

Even in my later years, I did not shy from battle. I fought alongside my allies when needed, but I always remembered that a true leader must protect his people first. I carried both the traditions of my ancestors and the new ways that came with our friendship with the French.

** **

**The End of My Journey**

I lived to see over a hundred years, a rare gift from the Creator. My life spanned the time before the French arrived and the years when they became part of our world. When I died in 1611, I left behind a bond between my people and the newcomers—a bond of trust and cooperation that endured beyond my years.

 

 

**Indigenous Alliances and Friendship – Told by Chief Membertou**

When the French first came to our shores, I was already an old man, a leader who had seen many seasons. They arrived in strange ships, carrying goods of iron, cloth, and weapons. At first, we watched them with caution, for many newcomers to these lands brought danger. But soon, we saw that these Frenchmen sought more than conquest. They sought friendship, and I believed that such a bond could bring strength to both our peoples.

** **

**Why We Chose Alliance**

The Mi’kmaq, like other nations of our region, lived by hunting, fishing, and moving with the rhythms of the land. We understood that the French could not survive here without guidance. In return for our knowledge of the land and its ways, they offered us tools and weapons that made our lives easier and safer. It was a partnership born not of weakness but of choice, for together we could face the challenges of rival nations and the hardships of the land.

** **

**The Role of Trade**

Trade was the heart of our friendship. We brought furs, fish, and food, while the French gave us kettles, knives, and muskets. These exchanges were not only of goods but of trust. Each trade was a promise that we valued one another. The fur trade in particular tied us together, for it gave the French wealth and gave us the means to thrive in a changing world.

** **

**The Importance of Respect**

Respect was the foundation of our alliance. The French listened to our counsel, joined us in feasts, and fought alongside us when enemies threatened. They did not demand that we abandon our ways but sought to walk beside us. I myself chose baptism as a sign of unity, showing that our lives could be bound together in spirit as well as in trade.

** **

**A Friendship That Endured**

These alliances shaped the beginnings of New France. Without our support, the French would not have survived their first winters, nor could they have built Quebec. Without their goods, our people would have faced greater dangers from enemies armed with foreign weapons. Our friendship was not simply convenience; it was survival, strength, and the weaving together of two worlds.

 

 

**The Founding of Quebec (1608) – Told by Samuel de Champlain**

In 1608, I sailed once again across the Atlantic, determined to establish a permanent settlement for France. I chose a site along the St. Lawrence River, a place the Indigenous peoples called Kebec, meaning “where the river narrows.” The high cliffs, fertile ground, and strategic position made it ideal for defense and trade. Here, I believed, a new France could take root.

** **

**Building the Settlement**

With my men, I began the hard work of building. We cleared the forest, raised wooden palisades, and constructed simple buildings for shelter and storage. The settlement was small, but I envisioned it as the seed of something greater. Every log we placed and every trench we dug was a step toward France’s future in the New World.

** **

**The Hardships of Winter**

Our first winter was cruel beyond measure. Bitter cold swept through the settlement, food supplies ran low, and disease took hold. Many of my men grew weak, and nearly half perished before spring returned. It was a time of great sorrow, yet we endured. Without the assistance of our Indigenous allies, who shared food and knowledge, none of us would have survived.

**A Place of Trade and Alliance**

Despite the hardships, Quebec became more than a settlement; it became a gathering place. From here, we could trade furs with the Huron, Algonquin, and Montagnais. It was also a place to build alliances, to strengthen bonds that ensured our survival and secured France’s claim to this vast land.

** **

**The Heart of New France**

Quebec was not only a fort or a trading post; it was the heart of New France. From this place, journeys of exploration began, alliances were formed, and the French presence in North America grew. I dreamed that one day it would be a thriving city, a beacon of France across the ocean. Though we suffered greatly, the founding of Quebec marked the beginning of a new chapter in history, one that would shape generations to come.

 

 

**My Name is Étienne Brûlé: Interpreter and Adventurer in New France**

I was born around 1592 in France, a common boy with little wealth or name. Unlike nobles or merchants, I had no inheritance to claim, only my courage and my curiosity. When I heard of voyages to the New World, I saw a chance to live a life of adventure beyond anything my birthplace could offer.

** **

**Crossing the Atlantic**

As a teenager, I sailed with Samuel de Champlain across the ocean. He saw in me a bold spirit and chose me to live among the Indigenous peoples as an interpreter. My task was to learn their languages, their customs, and to build bonds of trust. I was one of the first Frenchmen to live entirely within their world.

** **

**Life Among the Huron**

I lived with the Huron and learned their ways. I dressed as they did, ate their food, and joined them in the hunt. I became a bridge between two cultures, carrying knowledge back to Champlain while showing the Huron that the French were not just strangers but potential allies.

** **

**Exploring the Land**

My wanderings took me farther than most Europeans of my time. I traveled west beyond the Great Lakes, into lands no Frenchman had seen before. I carried the spirit of discovery within me, eager to learn and to see what lay beyond the next river or forest.

** **

**A Divided Loyalty**

But living between two worlds is never simple. Some said I became more Huron than French, and that I no longer served Champlain as faithfully as before. Tensions grew, and whispers of betrayal followed me. Still, I believed my life was my own, and I had earned the right to walk my own path.

** **

**My End**

Around 1633, my story came to a violent close. Accounts say I was killed by the Huron, the very people I had lived among for so many years. Whether it was for politics, anger, or mistrust, I cannot say. My body was lost to the forest, leaving only stories of my wandering life.

** **

**My Legacy**

Though my life ended in shadows, I was among the first to truly live between the French and the First Nations. I showed that survival in New France required understanding, respect, and courage. I was not a king or a governor, but an adventurer whose footsteps reached farther than most dared to go.

 

 

**Cultural Exchanges and Learning from Each Other – Told by Étienne Brûlé**

When Champlain chose me to live among the Huron and Algonquin, I was still a youth, eager for adventure. I left behind the familiar ways of France and stepped into a world where every detail of life was new. I learned their languages, shared their food, and joined them in the hunt. To them, I was a guest at first, but over time I became part of their community.

** **

**Adopting Their Ways**

I wore their clothing of animal skins, painted my face as they did, and followed their customs. This was not disguise but survival, for in the forests and rivers of this land, French habits alone would not keep a man alive. I learned to paddle a canoe swiftly through rapids, to follow the trails through endless woods, and to live in harmony with the land as they had done for generations.

** **

**The Bridge Between Two Worlds**

My role was not only to learn but also to connect. I carried knowledge back to Champlain, telling him what I had seen, the strengths of the nations, and the shape of the land beyond. At the same time, I spoke for the French among the Huron and Algonquin, building trust where fear might have ruled. In this way, I became a bridge between two worlds, though I often felt torn between them.

** **

**What the French Learned**

The French could not have survived without the knowledge of the peoples of this land. We learned to grow corn, to hunt moose and deer, and to prepare food that could last through long winters. Snowshoes, canoes, and ways of shelter all came from them. Their knowledge became our lifeline, and without it, New France would have perished before it began.

** **

**The Meaning of Exchange**

Cultural exchange was not only about survival but about understanding. I saw that the Huron and Algonquin valued community, respect for the land, and bonds of kinship above wealth or power. These lessons shaped me, and I carried them within me even when I returned to the French. In turn, we brought new tools, weapons, and beliefs that changed their world as well. Our lives were woven together, each depending on the other, and from that weaving the story of New France was written.

 

 

**The Role of Women in Alliances – Told by Henry IV and Chief Membertou**

**Henry IV: The European View**In the courts of France, women held influence, but it was often behind the scenes, through marriage, inheritance, or the counsel of queens and noblewomen. In matters of diplomacy and empire, men stood at the forefront. When I looked to the colonies, I imagined alliances formed through treaties, trade agreements, and the strength of arms. I did not see women as central to these ties, for our European view placed power in the hands of men.

** **

**Chief Membertou: Women as Keepers of Balance**

Among the Mi’kmaq and many other nations, women hold a vital place in guiding decisions. They are the keepers of families and the voices of continuity. When marriages linked our people with the French, women bound two worlds together. They brought peace where there might have been conflict, teaching the newcomers how to live with us and showing their children how to walk in both traditions. Without women, no alliance could endure, for they carried it into the heart of the family and the village.

** **

**Henry IV: The Overlooked Influence**

Your words show me a truth we in Europe often ignored. While we focused on trade and politics, we did not always see the quiet strength that women brought to such bonds. We celebrated the bravery of soldiers and the cunning of merchants, yet perhaps we failed to recognize that true unity comes not only from agreements signed by men but from the ties woven within families and daily life.

** **

**Chief Membertou: The Power of Continuity**

Yes, and that is why their role must be remembered. Women ensured that knowledge, language, and tradition passed to the next generation. They taught children the stories of their ancestors and, when joined with the French, opened doors of understanding between our peoples. An alliance sealed in words is fragile, but one lived daily in the home is strong. Women gave that strength, though their names are rarely written in the records of your people.

** **

**Two Worlds, Two Understandings**

Thus we see the difference between us. To the French crown, alliances were matters of politics, religion, and commerce. To us, they were woven into the family, guided by the wisdom of women as much as the authority of men. Both views shaped the meeting of our worlds, but without the unseen work of women, the friendship between our peoples might never have endured.

 

 

**The Fur Trade and Economy of New France – Told by Henry IV of France**

In my time, fur was not a simple garment but a treasure of Europe. The beaver pelts of North America, in particular, were prized beyond measure. They were fashioned into felt hats that crowned the heads of nobles, merchants, and gentlemen across the continent. To wear such a hat was a mark of wealth and fashion, and demand seemed endless. For France, the fur trade offered not only riches but the chance to strengthen our position in the markets of Europe.

** **

**How Fur Drove Colonization**

It was fur that gave meaning to our first colonies. Men did not cross the ocean only for glory or to plant flags; they came to secure the wealth of the forests and rivers. Without the fur trade, Champlain would not have been able to sustain Quebec, nor would others have risked the long voyage across the sea. The fur trade fed the settlers, financed exploration, and kept the interest of merchants alive. In truth, it was the lifeblood of New France.

** **

**France Competing with Rivals**

Spain had its silver and gold from the New World, while England pushed for colonies along the Atlantic coast. France could not be left behind. We did not find great mines of gold, but in the fur trade we found our own treasure. Through alliances with the Huron, Algonquin, and Mi’kmaq, we secured access to vast supplies of pelts. This trade allowed France to compete with her rivals, for it gave us not only wealth but a strong foothold in the northern lands of America.

** **

**The Wider Dream of Economy**

The fur trade was only the beginning of what I envisioned. I dreamed of farms, fisheries, and industries in the New World that would one day make France self-sufficient and powerful. But fur was the key that opened the door. It proved to my people that New France could succeed, and it gave reason for ships to cross the Atlantic year after year. Without the wealth of fur, the dream of a French empire across the ocean might never have taken root.

 

 

**Conflicts and Warfare – Told by Samuel de Champlain**

From the moment we set foot in New France, I understood that survival depended on alliances. The land was vast, and the peoples who lived here were many and strong. To endure, the French could not stand alone. We allied with the Algonquin, Huron, and Montagnais, who welcomed our friendship and our weapons in their struggles against their enemies.

** **

**The First Battle with the Iroquois**In 1609, I joined my allies on a campaign against the Iroquois. We marched together through the forests until we reached the waters now called Lake Champlain. There, we faced a force of Iroquois warriors. It was my first time standing in battle beside our allies, and I carried my arquebus, a weapon unknown to our enemies. When I fired, the thunder of the shot and the fall of their chiefs startled and scattered them. Victory was swift, but its memory would shape the future.

** **

**The Opportunities of Friendship**By fighting beside my allies, I proved that the French were not distant merchants but true partners. Our willingness to shed blood together deepened bonds of trust. These battles secured the fur trade routes and gave us stronger ties with the Huron and Algonquin. Through them, France’s presence in North America was strengthened, and Quebec grew more secure.

** **

**The Dangers of Enmity**Yet I also understood the danger of making enemies. The Iroquois did not forget that day. Our weapon had given fearsome power to our alliance, and in their eyes, the French became a threat to be hunted. For years to come, the Iroquois would strike against us, challenging our settlements and trade. In choosing sides, we gained friends, but we also made lasting enemies.

** **

**The Lessons of Warfare**Conflict taught me that war in this new land was unlike that of Europe. It was fought in forests, rivers, and ambushes, with courage and cunning more valuable than great armies. It also taught me that the fate of New France would always be tied to its alliances. Victory and survival depended not only on French strength but on the friendships we built and the enemies we made.

 

 

**The Indigenous Worldview of the Land – Told by Chief Membertou**

To my people, the Mi’kmaq, the land is not something to be bought or sold. It is a living spirit, a gift from the Creator, given for all to share. The forests, rivers, and coasts provide us with food, shelter, and medicine, but they also carry stories and memories of those who came before us. To walk upon the land is to walk in the footsteps of our ancestors.

** **

**Living With the Land**We do not seek to conquer the land but to live with it. Each season guides our movement. In spring and summer we fish and gather near the coast, while in autumn and winter we hunt inland. We take only what we need and give thanks for what is provided. In this balance, the land continues to sustain us, and we, in turn, honor it with respect and care.

** **

**The European View**When the French came, I saw a different way of thinking. They built walls, marked boundaries, and spoke of owning land as if it could belong to one man alone. They measured fields and forests, claiming them for kings across the sea. To us, this seemed strange, for no person can own the rivers or the wind. The land belongs to itself, and we belong to it.

** **

**A Contrast of Dreams**This difference in vision shaped our friendship. We welcomed the French because they sought trade and alliance, not conquest. Yet I also knew that their hunger for settlement would one day press against our way of life. They dreamed of building farms and towns, while we dreamed of continuing the cycle of life with the land.

** **

**The Lesson of Respect**The greatest lesson I can share is that survival depends on harmony with the earth. The land gives life, but it must be honored. If treated as a possession, it can be destroyed. If treated as a partner, it will sustain countless generations. This is the wisdom of my people, and it is the gift we offered the French when they first came to our shores.

 

 

**Land Ownership and Displacement – Told by Champlain and Chief Membertou**

**Champlain: The First Settlements**When I first crossed into the lands of the St. Lawrence, my goal was trade, not conquest. The fur trade gave us reason to stay, and the friendships with the Huron, Algonquin, and Montagnais made our presence possible. But as the years passed, I saw that trade alone could not sustain New France. To secure food, stability, and permanence, farms and villages became necessary. Clearing land for crops seemed a natural step to us, for in France, ownership of land was the foundation of all society.

** **

**Membertou: The Land as Shared Spirit**For my people, the Mi’kmaq, and for many others, the land was never something to own. It was a gift from the Creator, to be shared by all who lived upon it. We moved with the seasons, following the fish, the hunt, and the harvest. To cut the forests and mark the soil as belonging to one man or one family was a way of life we did not understand. When the French first came only to trade, we welcomed them gladly. But when they began to settle, to build walls and claim fields, it changed the nature of our friendship.

** **

**Champlain: The European View of Land**In France, to live without claim to land was unthinkable. A farm was not only food but wealth, inheritance, and legacy. To establish New France as a true colony, we needed fields of wheat, orchards of apples, and herds of livestock. We believed that clearing the forests and planting crops brought improvement to the land. To us, unclaimed soil was wasted, waiting to be given purpose. We did not see this as theft, but as progress.

** **

**Membertou: The Roots of Displacement**Yet what you saw as progress brought us sorrow. The more you settled, the more our hunting grounds shrank. The fields of corn and wheat blocked the paths of deer, and the walls around villages cut us off from places where we once fished or gathered. Your way of life demanded permanence, but ours was shaped by movement. Slowly, our people found themselves pressed into smaller spaces, and with every harvest of yours, we lost part of our own.

** **

**Champlain: The Conflict of Two Worlds**I will not deny the truth in your words. Our farming altered the balance of the land. It was not my intent to drive your people away, yet I knew that each new ship from France carried settlers who dreamed of land to call their own. The vision of New France was one of permanence, and permanence demanded settlement. This created tension I could not resolve. For the dream of my king and the survival of my colony pulled me toward farming, even as I wished for peace with you.

** **

**Membertou: The Price of Friendship**We welcomed you as guests and allies, but as your numbers grew, we became strangers in our own country. Though you spoke of friendship, your way of life made it hard to share. We gave guidance, food, and knowledge, yet in return we found our hunting grounds turned to plowed fields. This was not done with cruelty perhaps, but the result was the same: slow displacement, the steady loss of what had always been ours.

** **

**A Shared but Divided Vision**Here lies the heart of our debate. To Champlain and his people, the land was a resource to be divided, owned, and improved. To us, it was a living spirit, shared among all, never belonging to one alone. At first, trade allowed these views to coexist. But as settlement grew, the two visions collided. Each side believed their way was right, yet neither could fully grasp the other. From this misunderstanding came the roots of conflict, a wound that would grow deeper long after Champlain and I were gone.

** **

**The Legacy of Land**The issue of land ownership and displacement was not settled in our time. It became the lasting struggle of New France and beyond. For every farm that flourished, a hunting ground was lost. For every new village, an old path was closed. What began as friendship built on trade turned slowly into rivalry over space and survival. This truth, more than battles or treaties, shaped the future of our peoples.

**Violence and Revenge in Alliances – Told by Champlain and Chief Membertou**

**Champlain: The Need for Partnership**From the first days in New France, I saw that survival depended on alliances. The French were few, and the land was vast. To win trust, I joined the Algonquin and Huron in their wars against the Iroquois. I believed that by standing with them, I proved we were true allies and not mere traders. Yet in doing so, I also bound the French to old rivalries that were not ours, drawing us into conflicts that endured long after the battles ended.

** **

**Membertou: The Value of Loyalty**In our way, alliances are tested in war. To share trade is one thing, but to stand together in battle shows whether a friend can be trusted. When you, Champlain, fought beside us against the Iroquois, you honored your word and strengthened our bond. Yet by bringing your thunder-weapons into the fight, you changed the balance. Victories that might have taken seasons were won in moments, and enemies did not forget. Your help gave us strength, but it also planted deeper hatred.

** **

**Champlain: The Burden of Enmity**You speak true, Membertou. My weapons gave advantage, but they also marked the French as enemies of the Iroquois. From that day forward, they saw us not as strangers but as rivals in their wars. Their raids threatened our settlements, and the dream of peace became harder to hold. In seeking friendship, I also made lasting enemies, a burden that fell upon every colonist who came after me.

** **

**Membertou: The Cycle of Revenge**But we, too, share fault. Our people drew you into wars that had burned long before you arrived. We saw your weapons as a way to tilt the struggle in our favor, but we did not think of how this bound you to our causes. In victory, we celebrated; in revenge, we called upon you again. We treated the French as warriors, not only as partners in trade, and in doing so, we placed you in dangers you did not fully understand.

** **

**The Shared Responsibility**Thus both of us bear blame. I, Champlain, in choosing to take sides when perhaps I should have stood apart. And I, Membertou, in seeking advantage without weighing the cost to our friendship. Violence bound us together, but it also divided us from others. Alliances made New France strong, yet they also drew us into the endless cycle of revenge that shapes our world. It is a truth that both strengthened and endangered all we built together.

 

 

**Everyday Life in New France – Told by Étienne Brûlé**

Life in New France was not like life in the cities and towns of France. Here, winters were long and harsh, and the forests stretched farther than the eye could see. The French who came across the ocean soon learned that survival required change. We could not live as we had in Europe; we had to adapt to the land and learn from those who knew it best.

** **

**Food and Hunting**Our meals depended on what the land provided. Corn, beans, and squash, taught to us by Indigenous neighbors, became staples in our diet. Hunting provided moose, deer, and smaller game, while fishing filled our pots with salmon and eels. Without these lessons, the French would have starved, for European crops grew poorly in this new soil. The wisdom of our allies sustained us more than anything we brought across the sea.

** **

**Clothing for the Seasons**The winters of New France punished anyone who clung to the fashions of Europe. Heavy wool was not enough to endure the bitter cold. We borrowed clothing styles from the Indigenous peoples: furs for warmth, moccasins for travel in snow, and snowshoes to walk across frozen ground. These garments were not just practical but essential, and soon the French settlers dressed much like their neighbors when the cold arrived.

** **

**Shelter and Living**The first houses were simple wooden structures, but over time, settlers borrowed ideas from Indigenous shelters to withstand the weather. Longhouses and wigwams inspired techniques that kept homes warmer and sturdier. Fire was not only for heat but for survival, and wood had to be gathered in great amounts to last a single winter.

** **

**The Blending of Cultures**Everyday life became a weaving together of French and Indigenous practices. Canoes carried us swiftly along rivers, just as the peoples of the land had done for centuries. Food, clothing, and tools all bore the mark of cultural exchange. This blending gave New France its unique character, for we were not only French anymore, but something new—shaped by the land and the friendships we made.

 

 

**Disease and Population Loss – Told by Chief Membertou**

When the French first came to our shores, they brought with them goods and knowledge that changed our lives. Yet hidden among these gifts was something far more dangerous. Strange sicknesses spread through our villages, diseases that our healers did not know and our bodies had never faced. At first, we thought they were curses or punishments, but soon we saw that they came with the arrival of the newcomers.

** **

**The Spread Through Villages**The sickness moved quickly, faster than our people could flee. One person would fall ill, then whole families, and before long entire villages were weakened. Our numbers fell sharply, and with every death, our ability to hunt, fish, and defend ourselves was broken. Where once the forests were filled with the voices of many, silence took their place.

** **

**The Change in Balance of Power**These losses struck at the strength of nations. Allies and enemies alike were weakened, but not always equally. Some communities disappeared entirely, while others held on with fewer people to protect their lands. Old rivalries were reshaped by the devastation. The French, though fewer in number, seemed strong beside us, for they carried resistance to the sickness we could not withstand.

** **

**The Lasting Scars**The epidemics left marks that could not be healed. Families lost whole generations, and the stories of elders were silenced too soon. Children grew up without parents, and leaders struggled to guide their people through grief. Even as we built alliances with the French and shared trade, we carried the sorrow of loss with us. The scars of these sicknesses remained in our hearts, reminders of how fragile life had become.

** **

**What Endured Despite Suffering**Though disease tried to erase us, we did not vanish. We mourned, we remembered, and we adapted. We held tightly to our traditions and our identity, even as we struggled to survive. The arrival of the French changed our world in many ways, but the strength of the Mi’kmaq and other nations was not destroyed. We endured, carrying our story forward, even through sorrow and loss.

 

 

**Religion and Conversion – Told by Henry IV of France and Chief Membertou**

**Henry IV: The Goal of France**As king, I sought not only to bring peace to France but to strengthen her abroad. Colonies were more than trade and territory; they were also a place to spread the Catholic faith. I wished to see missionaries sail with explorers, to carry the teachings of Christ to distant lands. By converting new peoples, France would show its devotion to God and stand as a champion of the Church. To me, religion was a foundation for unity, both at home and across the ocean.

** **

**Chief Membertou: A Leader’s Choice**When the French spoke of their faith, I listened carefully. I saw their devotion and their desire to bring us into their spiritual family. In 1610, I chose baptism for myself and my family. I believed this act would strengthen our bonds with the French, making our friendship more than an alliance of trade and war. Yet I did not abandon the teachings of my ancestors. My identity remained rooted in the land and in the traditions of my people, even as I accepted this new faith.

** **

**Henry IV: The Hope of Unity**For me, your baptism, Membertou, was a great sign that our dream could succeed. It showed that Indigenous leaders might walk beside us in faith as well as alliance. I believed that such unity would make New France strong, for a colony bound together by religion would stand firm against rival powers.

** **

**Chief Membertou: The Weight of Two Worlds**But for my people, the choice was not simple. Some saw baptism as a betrayal of our traditions. Others welcomed it as a way to build trust and ensure survival in a changing world. Conversion carried both hope and tension, for we sought to honor our ancestors while protecting our children. The cross of the French and the teachings of the Mi’kmaq did not always rest easily together, and that struggle became part of our lives.

** **

**A Shared but Unequal Dream**Religion, like trade and warfare, tied our worlds together. For the French, it was a mission to bring faith to new lands. For us, it was a decision made with care, weighing survival against tradition. My baptism symbolized the joining of two paths, yet beneath it lay questions that could never be answered easily: Could two ways of life truly share the same spirit, or would one always try to replace the other?

 

 

**The Legacy of Champlain – Told by Samuel de Champlain**

**My Role as Founder**When I look back upon my years, I see Quebec as my greatest work. What began as a handful of men by the river grew into the first heart of New France. I did not build it for myself alone, but for the generations that would follow, so that France might have a lasting presence across the ocean. My role was to plant the seed, though I knew others would water and nurture it after me.

** **

**Hopes for Cooperation**From the beginning, I dreamed of a colony where French and Indigenous peoples could live side by side in friendship. I saw the strength of our allies, their knowledge of the land, and their ways of life. I hoped that our two worlds might be joined not by conquest, but by mutual respect and shared survival. Though battles and mistrust sometimes clouded this vision, I never let go of the belief that cooperation was the key to enduring peace.

** **

**A Vision for the Future**I did not seek gold or riches as others did, but something greater. I wanted to see a society where faith, trade, and alliance could form the pillars of a new world. I dreamed of children born in Quebec who would know both French and Indigenous ways, who would call this land their home. That vision guided me through hardship, and it gave purpose to the dangers I faced.

** **

**How History Remembers**When I died in 1635, Quebec was still small, and much of my dream was unfinished. Yet I believe history remembers me not for the battles I fought, but for the hope I carried. My maps guided explorers for generations, my alliances shaped the course of the colony, and my settlement stood as a symbol of endurance. In time, New France grew, and with it the story of Canada began to take shape.

** **

**The Legacy I Leave**My legacy is not only the walls of Quebec or the maps I drew, but the idea that different peoples could come together to build something greater than themselves. That was the vision I offered to France and to the world. Though I could not see its full fruit, I trust that my footsteps marked the beginning of a path that others would continue long after I was gone.

 

 

**Historical Memory and Mythmaking – Told by Samuel de Champlain**

Long after my death, I was given the name “Father of New France.” It is a title spoken with pride, a recognition of my role in founding Quebec and securing France’s claim to North America. Yet as I reflect upon it, I cannot help but wonder whether such a name tells the whole story. Titles can honor, but they can also hide truths, turning a complex past into something too simple, too polished for memory.

** **

**The Role of Indigenous Allies**I did not build New France alone. Without the Algonquin, Huron, Montagnais, and Mi’kmaq, the French would not have survived their first winters, nor found paths into the interior. It was their knowledge that taught us how to endure the cold, how to hunt, how to travel the rivers and lakes. Their warriors stood beside us in battle, their families welcomed us into alliances, and their lands gave us food and trade. To call me the father of New France without naming them is to erase the very ground upon which the colony stood.

** **

**The Making of Legends**Yet I understand why legends are born. People prefer a single figure to carry the weight of memory, for it is easier to honor one name than to recount a thousand. In France, it was simpler to tell the story of Champlain, the explorer and founder, than to explain the many nations whose lives intertwined with ours. History often chooses heroes, even when those heroes stand upon the shoulders of others.

** **

**The Silence in Memory**But myth can silence. When I am remembered as the lone architect, the Indigenous voices are pushed to the shadows. Their sacrifices, their losses, and their resilience are forgotten, while my image is polished into something greater than it truly was. This is the danger of mythmaking: it hides the full truth in favor of a story that comforts or inspires.

** **

**The Shared Foundation**If I am to be called the father of New France, then I must insist that the mothers and fathers of the nations who stood with me be remembered as well. Membertou, who welcomed us; the Huron leaders who guided us; the countless men and women who kept us alive when our own knowledge failed. They, too, are founders, though their names are not written in the records of Europe.

** **

**The Burden of Legacy**History remembers me with honor, but I wonder if it also burdens me with more than I deserve. My vision was never to stand alone, but to build a colony of cooperation and survival. The dream faltered at times, and conflict often outweighed peace. Still, I hoped that together French and Indigenous peoples might build something lasting. If memory forgets this balance, then my story is incomplete.

** **

**The Truth Beneath the Myth**So I leave this reflection: I am remembered as the father of New France, but I was also a student of the peoples who lived here long before me. My maps may have charted rivers and lakes, but it was their knowledge that showed me the way. My settlement may have planted roots, but it was their friendship that kept it alive. If history wishes to honor me, let it also honor them, for without their strength, there would be no New France at all.
