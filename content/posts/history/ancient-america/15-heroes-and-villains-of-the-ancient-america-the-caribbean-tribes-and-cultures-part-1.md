**I Am Yma Sumac's Ancestor: A Shaman’s Story from the Amazon**

I came into this world when the rivers were young and the sky sang low to the forest. My mother gave birth to me on a woven mat of palm fronds, beside the Orinoco’s sacred bend. My people had no temples of stone—we worshiped in the green cathedrals of trees, under the gaze of jaguars and the whispering wings of parrots. I was born under a blood moon, and the elders said the spirits of the water marked me. I was chosen to listen, not just to speak. To see, not just to look. So I began my journey as a listener of the forest and a servant of the breath of life.

** **

**The Path of the Shaman**

I was taught to fast before I was taught to eat with others. I learned the language of birds, the trail of ants, the stories of stones. My first teacher was an old woman who wore feathers and silence as her armor. She showed me how to find the ayahuasca vine and how to dream with it. She taught me to hear the voice of the river when no one else could. In time, I joined the circle of shamans, those who walked between this world and the next. We healed the sick with roots, calmed storms with chants, and guided the dead with smoke and song.

** **

**When the Canoes Pointed North**

Our people did not stay still. The forest is alive, always moving, always giving and asking. We built long canoes from tree trunks, taught by the spirits how to hollow them with fire and patience. We followed the rivers like blood flowing through the veins of the land. Our cousins in the Arawakan-speaking villages spoke of new lands to the north, where the water was salty and the winds pulled you forward. I joined the journeys, not as a warrior, but as a keeper of omens. The birds told me when to leave. The river told me where to go.

** **

**First Sight of the Islands**

When our canoes finally touched the edges of the Lesser Antilles, I knew the spirits had kept their promise. These were not lands of endless trees, but of open skies, rocky shores, and caves filled with echoes. We brought our gods with us in carved idols and songs. We planted cassava in the new soil. We mixed the salt of the sea with the knowledge of the jungle. And there, among the hills and coves, we became something new—still of the river, but now children of islands, too.

** **

**Carriers of the Sacred Flame**

Wherever we went, we carried the sacred fire in clay vessels, tended by the oldest hands. That fire came from the lightning that struck the heart of the forest. It was not just warmth—it was memory. We taught those who welcomed us how to cook cassava, how to shape pots that could hold spirits, how to call down the rain when the sky had forgotten us. We did not conquer. We seeded. We shared. Our ceremonies were held under the same stars, whether they hung above the basin or the open sea.

** **

**Before the Storm**

In my later years, I saw others follow our path. More canoes, more mouths, more zemis carved from stone instead of wood. The balance was shifting. I dreamed of a time when strangers would come not from the rivers, but from beyond the horizon, with skin pale as sand and eyes like still water. I told the elders to remember who we were—not because we feared the future, but because memory is the strongest shield. The forest forgets nothing. Neither should we.

** **

**I Am the Voice of the River**

You may not know my name, for we wrote no books. But I have lived in the chant of frogs, in the smoke of healing fires, and in the painted stories on cave walls. I am the river’s voice, and through me, the people who gave life to the Caribbean islands still speak. We were not primitive. We were guided. We were not lost. We were looking. And in the islands, we found a place to begin again. If you remember this, then we still live.

 

 

**Great Canoe Journeys: Migrations from South America** **- Told by Sumac’s Ancestor**

Long before your calendars began, when the world was still young and the trees had not yet forgotten how to speak, we lived deep within the lungs of the earth—the Amazon. Our villages clung to the riverbanks like children to their mother’s arms. We listened to the whispers of water and wind, to the songs of birds that flew in spirals above the canopy. The Orinoco and the Amazon were not just rivers—they were veins of spirit, pulsing with the breath of the land. They taught us that to move was not to leave, but to grow. They told us, again and again, “The sea is waiting.”

** **

**Reading the Stars and the Water**

We were not a people who wandered without purpose. We waited for the sky to tell us when. Each night, we watched the stars shift across the heavens. The jaguar constellation hunted the deer, and the fish-star leapt toward the moon. These were signs. The wind, too, spoke. It came from the north, carrying salt and calling to our bones. The river’s current, swollen after the rains, pushed harder toward the sea. The spirits gave their blessing in dreams, in omens, in the silent fluttering of moths before the dawn. So we carved our canoes from the sacred trees and readied ourselves.

** **

**The Hollowing of Trees and the Shaping of Purpose**

Our canoes were not simple things. Each was born from a tree that had stood long enough to gather memory. We spoke to the tree before we felled it. We offered tobacco, song, and silence. Then came the fire, slowly burning out its heart, and the adzes that shaped its ribs. When the canoe was ready, it was painted with red ochre and black ash. Each paddle was carved with the face of a guardian spirit. The women packed cassava bread, calabashes of water, and small stones from the sacred river to carry our ancestors with us.

** **

**From River to Sea**

When the first paddles touched saltwater, we knew we had crossed into a new world. The rivers had prepared us for the sea. We hugged the coast, following the curl of the continent. Sometimes we stopped where the land welcomed us, where the soil smelled right and the spirits hummed in the wind. Other times, we pushed onward, across channels that looked like open mouths, daring to swallow us. But we were not afraid. We trusted the old stories. And the stars—they never left us.

** **

**First Touch of Island Stone**

The islands rose like turtle shells from the sea. Some were flat and hot. Others stood tall, crowned with cloud. We landed first on those closest to the coast—Trinidad, then the little sisters to the north. They were wild, untouched, but they did not reject us. We found food, water, and trees that bent like those of the homeland. We brought cassava cuttings and fire, and with them, we brought memory. Soon, we were planting, fishing, singing. We were not visitors. We were home.

** **

**We Were Not Alone**

In time, we met others. Some were the children of hunters, old ones who had crossed into the islands long before us, carrying only stone tools and silent knowledge. We traded with them. We shared salt and seeds, and sometimes, we quarreled. But even when we fought, we knew we were bound by the sea. More of our people came in waves—our cousins, our elders, our daughters and sons. They carried painted pots, sacred animals, and stories of the river. And so, the Caribbean began to sing with new voices.

** **

**Why We Came**

You may ask why we left the river. It was not hunger. It was not war. It was the call of the spirits. The need to stretch, to offer our gifts to places that waited for them. We were never conquerors. We were planters of breath, seekers of balance. We followed the river to the sea because it is the way of life to flow, not to stay still. And as we moved, we carried the forest with us—its sounds, its smells, its soul. That soul still lingers in the songs of the islands, if you know how to listen.

** **

**Remember the Water Roads**

Now the rivers run quieter, and many have forgotten. But I remember. I was there when the stars aligned and the paddle struck salt. I was there when the first zemi was placed in the soil of a new island, carved from wood that still smelled of the jungle. I am the memory of the journey. I am the spirit of the canoe. I am the river’s voice, still flowing. If you speak these words and feel the pull of the wind, then perhaps the journey is not over.

 

 

**My Story by Cacina (Chief) Anacaona**: **The Voice of Xaragua**

I was born in the lush lowlands of Xaragua, a land kissed by warm trade winds and nestled between forested hills and the turquoise sea. My name, Anacaona, means "Golden Flower," and from a young age, I was trained not only to sing and dance the areytos of our ancestors, but to remember every line of our people’s memory. My brother, Bohechío, was our cacique, a wise leader who guided our chiefdom with fairness and strength. I was raised in his court among the bohíos of the nitainos and the bohíques, taught to observe and listen, for one day, I would be called upon to lead in my own way.

** **

**Keeper of the Areytos**

I learned to compose areytos—sung stories that honored the gods, the land, and our ancestors. These songs were our history. They spoke of the canoe journeys from the south, the rise of our Saladoid ancestors, the zemis who dwelled in stone and wood, and the spirits that guided the conucos where our cassava thrived. At night, by firelight, I would perform with the women of my clan, our voices rising into the moonlit sky, our feet pounding the earth in rhythms passed down for generations. This was how I preserved our stories. This was how I came to know my people.

** **

**Marriage and Diplomacy**

In time, I married Caonabo, the powerful cacique of Maguana. He was fierce in battle and silent in council, a man whose strength protected the highlands of Hispaniola. Our union was more than love—it was a joining of nations. Together, we sought to unite our islands in peace and purpose, to bring strength through alliance. I traveled across the yucayeques, speaking to elders, singing with women, trading stories with children. They called me sister and queen. And I listened to their fears, their dreams, and their hopes for our children’s future.

** **

**A World Before the Storm**

I remember the world before it changed. The bateyes filled with laughter and sport. The sacred caves where the spirits whispered. The conucos ripe with cassava and maize. Our people lived in harmony with the land. We honored the zemis with song and sacrifice, guided by the bohíques and protected by our caciques. The sea brought visitors and trade, not danger. We were strong, connected across islands, each chiefdom with its own stories, yet all singing from the same ancient root.

** **

**My Legacy**

Though I am known in many songs for what happened after the pale men arrived, I speak now only of the world I knew before. A world of balance, of voices raised in unity, of women who led not just in the home, but in the spirit and heart of the people. I was not only the wife of a chief or the sister of one. I was Anacaona, a poet, a diplomat, and a keeper of memory.

 

If you remember anything from my story, let it be this: that the Caribbean once bloomed with golden flowers of wisdom, song, and strength. And in every areyto that still echoes in the hills, we live on.

** **

** **

**Rise of the Saladoid Culture: Pottery, Ceremonies, and Farming - Told by Anacaona**

Though I was born a daughter of the Taino in the land of Xaragua, I carry in my blood the memory of those who came before—the Saladoid, our honored ancestors who arrived on these islands long before my songs were first sung. I have heard the elders whisper of their coming, not as conquerors, but as planters of peace and beauty. It is their hands I feel when I shape words into verse, their spirit I hear in the rustle of the cassava leaves. I sing now of their rise, so that you may know how their footsteps became the path for all who followed.

** **

**The People of Painted Clay**

The Saladoid came in canoes from the great rivers to the south, their paddles guided by stars and wind, their hearts carrying the spirits of the Orinoco. They were not only seekers of land—they were artists, carrying fire in their pots and songs in their bones. They brought with them pottery unlike anything the older ones had ever seen—bowls and vessels shaped with soft curves, painted with sacred lines in red, white, and black. These were not merely containers for food. They were the skin of ceremony, the voice of the spirit world. Each design told a story, honored an ancestor, or called upon a god. Even now, we find shards of their pottery buried beneath our villages, as if the earth itself remembers their craft.

** **

**From Camps to Communities**

Before the Saladoid, the first islanders moved like birds, setting camp by the tides and following the seasons. But these new ones settled. They cleared land and built round bohíos with thatched roofs, gathering in circles where kin and clan could live side by side. Their yucayeques grew near rivers and coasts, where water gave life and fish gave song. They laid out their homes with care, and from that care, community grew. The village became more than shelter—it became family. And from those first circles of home came the great chiefdoms that shaped my world.

** **

**The Sacred Gardens**

The greatest gift of the Saladoid was not their clay, but their cassava. From their homeland, they brought the cuttings of the sacred yuca plant and the knowledge to make it safe and sustaining. They taught us how to press out its poison, how to grind it on smooth stones, and how to bake it on clay griddles over open flame. This bread became the root of life. They did not scatter their gardens at random. They raised conucos—mounded fields where cassava could breathe, where water could flow, where the earth could rest. These mounds were sacred. Planting was a ritual. Harvesting was a song. The Saladoid turned soil into spirit, and through them, the land itself became holy.

** **

**Ceremonies of Balance**

The Saladoid did not separate daily life from the divine. Every act—grinding, planting, shaping clay, lighting a fire—was part of the greater balance. They held ceremonies in open plazas, calling to the zemis with music and motion. They danced in circles, painted their bodies with ash and ochre, and wore feathers to become like birds, messengers between sky and soil. Their rituals honored rain and sun, seed and stone. From them, we learned that the world is not to be taken, but to be danced with, shared like a bowl passed in peace.

** **

**Why Their Story Matters**

Without the Saladoid, there would be no Taino. Their hands carved the first paths into the island forest. Their pots held the first sacred waters. Their conucos fed the first generations that stood still long enough to dream of gods. I may be remembered for my poems, my councils, my courage—but all of these rise from the roots the Saladoid planted. To honor them is to honor ourselves. Their memory is not only beneath the soil. It is in the shape of our homes, the rhythm of our harvests, the stories painted on every face of the land. So I sing of them now. May their spirits hear, and may you remember.

** **

** **

**I Am Caonabo’s Elder: Keeper of Memory**

I was born in the central mountains of Bohío, what the world now calls Hispaniola, long before the pale-skinned ones came from the sea. My people called our land sacred. The rivers sang to us. The hills embraced us like ancestors still watching. I was born under the shadow of the great ceiba tree, in a yucayeque where stone tools still shaped our days, but the knowledge of pottery, of cassava, and of ritual was already deep in our bones. My name has been forgotten by time, but I was elder to Caonabo, a man who would one day shake the earth with his anger and pride. But I was a child long before he was born. I saw the pieces of our past stitched together with fire and earth.

** **

**Echoes of the First Peoples**

I remember the stories of the Ortoiroid and Casimiroid, people who lived here before us. They were hunters, fishers, and wanderers, carrying only stone blades, woven baskets, and the wisdom of the land. They left behind shell mounds and tools that we still unearthed from riverbanks. My grandfather told me of how they hunted manatees and made canoes from single trees. They did not build villages like ours or farm cassava, but they knew the spirits of the island. We honored them by not forgetting. Their blood ran with ours.

** **

**The Coming of the Saladoid**

When I was still young, our elders taught us about the ones who came after—the Saladoid. They brought colors to the earth. Pottery, painted in reds and whites, smooth and sacred. They knew how to raise gardens with cassava, sweet potato, maize, and cotton. They carved zemis from stone and wood, idols of the spirit-beings that guided our lives. They built large bohíos and made pacts with the sea. They came from the south, drifting on the currents, Arawakan tongues on their lips, songs in their chests. We are their children.

** **

**Raised in a Changing World**

My youth was a time of growing villages and expanding memory. I watched the bateyes fill with children learning to play, warriors sharpening stone axes, women weaving hammocks and grinding cassava into bread. The bohíques sang to the zemis and healed the sick with roots and whispers. I was chosen to learn the songs of the ancestors. I did not become a cacique or a warrior, but a listener, a rememberer. I traveled to distant yucayeques to gather the stories of our people—the migrations, the cave origins, the first planting of the sacred conuco mounds.

** **

**Caonabo, My Blood**

When my younger kin Caonabo was born, I knew the land had sent us a man of fire. Even as a child, he carried storms behind his eyes. I told him the stories of our people—how we once lived only from the land and sea, how we built villages from unity, how the spirits shaped the stones of the hills. He listened, though he often looked away, as if already dreaming of battles yet to come. I watched him grow into a leader, one who would defend our mountains and memory with rage and cunning. He would become a name feared and sung. But I—his elder—remained the one who reminded him who we were before we became warriors.

** **

**Winds Before the Storm**

In the last years of my life, I felt a tension in the air. The skies seemed more restless. Strange omens appeared—droughts too long, stars out of place. The elders whispered that change was near. But still, we danced, we sang the areytos. We honored the spirits. The young trained, the old remembered. We did not yet know the shape of what was coming across the sea. But I knew this: that our people were ancient, and the memory of who we were would not vanish, even if our names were someday forgotten.

** **

**I Speak So You Remember**

My name is lost, but my voice is not. I am the elder who watched the old world become the new. I saw stone give way to pottery, wandering to planting, isolation to chiefdom. I remember the first peoples and the fire of the ones who came after. If you speak our names and remember our lives, then we are not gone. We are zemis in the roots and bones of this land. We are the voices still riding the wind across the mountains of Hispaniola.

 

 

**The Archaic Age: First Islanders and Stone Tool Cultures - Told by Caonabo’s Elder**

Before my time, before my grandfather's time, before even the first bohíos were raised from earth and wood, the islands already had watchers. The sea was older than our blood, and the mountains stood in silence, waiting. But they were not empty. Long ago, the first people arrived—not in great canoes, not in vast numbers, but in small families, drifting from the south and west like the seeds carried by birds. These were the ancient ones, the ancestors of silence. They were called by the sea and answered with their feet, with stone tools in hand and stories that would never be carved in clay.

** **

**The Casimiroid and Ortoiroid Peoples**

We call them Casimiroid and Ortoiroid, though they never spoke those names. They lived on the edges of land and water—coastal camps, sheltered caves, river mouths where fish were fat and the trees bore fruit without demand. They hunted turtles, caught crabs, and roasted conch in fire pits whose stones still whisper when we pass. Their tools were chipped from flint and coral, simple in form but sharp in purpose. Scrapers, spear points, heavy pounding stones. No pottery, no carvings of gods—just the skill of hands guided by need and patience. They were the first to tame the islands by knowing them, not by changing them.

** **

**No Villages, But Home**

These people did not build yucayeques like ours. They moved with the seasons, following the fish, listening to the cycles of the moon and tide. They left no plazas, no ball courts, no painted pots—but they left bones, shells, and the markings of meals. In caves near the sea, their bones were buried with care, curled as if sleeping. They respected life and death as two halves of the same rhythm. Even now, we find their shell middens—heaps of ancient meals buried beneath soil and time. And when we do, we stop. We offer smoke or silence. We remember.

** **

**Their Ways Linger in Ours**

They taught no language that survived, yet I believe their ways breathe through ours. The way we fish with weirs and lines in narrow channels, the way we gather wild fruit during lean seasons, the way our hands shape stone when no metal will do—these things did not begin with us. They are echoes. I have seen a boy chip stone with no teacher, as if memory passed through his blood. That is the gift of the first islanders. They did not build empires, but they built foundation.

** **

**Before the Pots and Gods**

When the Saladoid came with their pots and zemis, when the cassava mounds rose and the caciques began to rule, the world began to change. But the old ones—the ones who knew the islands before they had names—still walked beside us. Some mingled, some vanished, and some, perhaps, simply became part of the land. I was taught to never speak of the present without bowing to the past. So I tell the story of the Archaic people, not with names and dates, but with reverence.

** **

**I Keep Their Fire Alive**

I am the elder who remembers. I have never seen the Casimiroid or Ortoiroid with my eyes, but I see them when the stone tool gleams in the sun, when the tide reveals a shell heap older than any tale, when the wind carries no voice yet speaks to the soul. They were the first. And though they did not write or sing or carve gods, they endured. And that, too, is a kind of greatness. If you walk the island and feel watched, know it is not fear—it is respect. The first islanders are still here. And I, Caonabo’s elder, remember so you can too.

 

 

**I am Maboya: War Chief of the Island Warriors**

I was born on the island the old ones called Waitukubuli—Dominica, the Tall One. Our island rose steep from the sea, wrapped in mist and draped in forest. The winds knew our names, and the birds carried our stories. My mother said I was born during a storm, when the sea roared like a jaguar and the trees bowed to the sky. That was a sign. The elders named me Maboya, after the restless spirits that move between this world and the next. They said I would be a bridge between danger and destiny. And they were right.

** **

**Raised by Warriors and Winds**

In my youth, I learned quickly that life in the Lesser Antilles was not gentle. The land gave us food, but it also demanded respect. My people, the Kalinago, were strong. We did not build kingdoms like the Taino. We built canoes, wove traps, carved bows, and trained our bodies. I was taught to move silently through the forest, to fish with bare hands, to climb the cliffs for salt and to dive into black waters for conch. I learned to listen to the drums of the sea and the warnings of birds. When I was ten, I killed my first wild pig. When I was thirteen, I carved my own spear. By fifteen, I was chosen to train with the war captains.

** **

**The Way of the Warrior**

To be Kalinago is to be more than brave—it is to be unbreakable. We taught our boys with scars, not words. Pain was a teacher, and silence was pride. We painted our bodies before battle with roucou and charcoal. We honored the ancestors with chants and dances, calling on the strength of those who came before us. The spirits of the forest and sea were our companions. They did not judge us—they guided us. I learned to lead raids in swift canoes, silent at dawn, slicing across the sea toward rival islands or Taino villages whose chiefs had insulted our people. We did not raid for cruelty, but for survival, for vengeance, for balance. If you cannot defend your home, you do not deserve to keep it.

** **

**Sea Roads and Island Smoke**

The sea was our road, and our canoes were our horses. We traded, we raided, we visited kin across the islands. The Kalinago were not isolated—we were many. From the southern islands of Guyana to the northernmost edges of the Antilles, our warriors moved like smoke, our songs echoing across the surf. We made peace with some, fought with others. There were times we married Taino women, times we burned Taino villages. We respected their gods, but we did not fear them. Our own spirits walked beside us—Maboyas, ancestors, and the fierce ones who never left the forest. Some call us savages. But tell me, what is savage about protecting your people with courage and fire?

** **

**Keeper of Fire, Voice of Thunder**

As I grew older, I became chief among my warriors. I led not only with strength but with listening. I walked the villages, spoke to the women who wove our hammocks and the elders who guarded the stories. I listened to the sea at night and dreamed of fire on the horizon. I knew that change was coming. The clouds carried whispers of pale men with strange clothes and louder weapons. The spirits stirred more fiercely. The wind changed direction. My sons sharpened their spears, and I did not stop them.

** **

**Remember Us**

I am Maboya. I do not know if you will say my name in your world. I do not know if my island still stands or if our canoes still glide across the water. But remember this—we were not waiting to be discovered. We were warriors, protectors, and voices of the wind. We carried memory in our drums and courage in our bones. If you tell our story with truth, then we are not gone. We are still sailing, still fighting, still alive in the spirit of the islands.

 

 

**Island Adaptation and Resource Use - Told by Carib War Chief Maboya**

When the first of our ancestors came to these islands, they found no softness waiting for them. The sea was vast and angry, the land steep and wild. These were not the soft valleys of the mainland, but cliffs that dropped into deep blue, forests thick with thorn, and winds that spoke without kindness. But the Kalinago are not ones to fear a hard land. We do not bend beneath it. We rise with it. Over many generations, we learned to read the signs of this place, to understand its rhythms, to live not in spite of it, but with it. That is what makes us island people—not by birth, but by mastery.

** **

**The Gift of Salt and Stone**

Our first lesson came from the rocks. On the edges of many islands, the sun left behind pools in stone basins, where the sea had crept in and retreated. In time, white crystals formed—salt. We gathered it with care, knowing it would keep our fish, flavor our food, and trade well with neighbors. Salt was the gold of our shores. From the mountains we found stones to shape into adzes and blades, to carve canoes, to skin fish. Every island gave something different—flint in one, clay in another, iron-colored rocks to grind and paint our bodies for battle. We did not mine the land as fools. We listened to it. We took only what it offered freely.

** **

**Masters of the Canoe**

The sea is our mother and our enemy. To survive, we became the best at riding her moods. Our canoes are long, narrow, and sharp like the beak of a hawk. We carve them from trees, fire-hollowed and shaped with stone and coral tools. We bind the edges with vines, seal the gaps with resin, and sometimes lash outriggers for balance in rough water. A good canoe can carry twenty warriors or three families and a harvest. In these, we travel from island to island, sometimes in peace, sometimes for war, but always with purpose. No wind or wave deters us. Our paddles beat with the rhythm of the sea.

** **

**Fishing with Wisdom, Not Force**

We are not wasteful. The sea gives, but it tests you first. We learned to fish with basket traps woven from reeds, set in narrow channels where fish would swim but not escape. We shaped barbed spears for shallow waters and made long lines for deeper ones. We knew when to fish and when to leave the waters to rest. The reef fish, the sea turtles, the conch and lobster—all of these we took, but we gave thanks. The women smoked the catch to preserve it. Nothing was wasted. A broken shell became a hook. A fish bone became a needle.

** **

**Fruits of Forest and Fire**

We did not only take from the sea. The island forests gave us yams, guavas, papayas, and healing plants. We hunted agouti and iguana, gathered honey, and used fire to clear paths and make the land breathe. We did not build vast farms like the Taino, but we grew cassava in open patches, taught by those who came before. We used digging sticks, not plows. The earth was not a beast to be tamed, but a friend to be fed and respected. When we cut a tree, we planted two. When we gathered fruit, we left some behind. That is the way.

** **

**Adapting Is Surviving**

The islands are not one place, but many. Each has its own rules. Some give water freely, others make you search. Some are guarded by reefs, others open to storm. But the Kalinago have learned them all. We made each place our own. We moved when the land told us to, returned when it welcomed us back. That is how we have survived—by watching, listening, adapting. Not with cities, not with monuments, but with knowledge passed from father to son, from grandmother to daughter. Knowledge written not in books, but in hands and habits.

** **

**The Warrior's Promise**

I am Maboya, a war chief, but I am also a son of the islands. I do not only fight to protect people. I fight to protect a way of life—one carved from stone, sung to the sea, and whispered by the wind. We are not visitors here. We are the ones who learned how to live where the land offers no comfort, only challenge. And in that challenge, we found strength. So remember, if you ever walk these shores and feel the sting of salt in your nose and the bite of stone beneath your feet, you are feeling the same lessons we once learned. The islands do not give freely—but they reward those who listen.

 

 

**Sacred Symbols: Zemis and Ancestral Spirits - Told by Yma Sumac’s Ancestor**

In the beginning, before the sea swallowed the horizon and before the canoes pointed north, our people lived by the rivers that curved through the green lungs of the world. The rivers were not only water—they were memory, flowing in the same direction as time. We believed that every tree had a voice, every stone had a name, and every ancestor became part of the wind once their breath left their body. It was from this sacred vision that the spirits we now call zemis were first born—not as idols, but as presence, as living echoes that followed us through the forest, whispered from the branches, and danced in the firelight.

** **

**The Birth of the Zemi**

We did not invent the zemi. We discovered it. It was already there—in the thunder that cracked the sky, in the tree roots that rose like bones from the soil, in the dreams that came after drinking the sacred vine. When a shaman entered trance, we saw the faces of those who had passed—their forms shaped by light and shadow. To honor them, we began to carve. At first it was wood, soft and warm like flesh. Then stone, hard and enduring like memory. These carvings were not meant to be worshipped. They were homes—places where spirit could dwell when it needed to visit the world of breath again.

** **

**Carving the Invisible**

To carve a zemi was not simple labor. It was ceremony. The carver would fast for days, speak to no one but the fire, and seek a vision of the spirit who wished to return. Only then would the carving begin—eyes wide to see beyond this world, mouths open to speak between the living and the dead. Some zemis took the form of animals—owls, jaguars, frogs. Others bore the faces of ancestors, grim and knowing. Some were small enough to wear around the neck. Others were tall and heavy, set in the center of the gathering place, watching over every ritual and offering.

**The Journey to the Caves**

As we moved northward into the islands, we carried our zemis in the canoes, wrapped in cloth, surrounded by song. We placed them in sacred caves, where the breath of the earth is still and cool. These caves were not empty—they were mouths of the underworld, where the ancestors sleep and listen. In the deepest parts, our people left offerings—beads, food, feathers, even blood. These were acts of love, not fear. The zemis were family. They reminded us of where we came from and where we would return.

** **

**The Role of the Shaman**

My duty was not just to speak to the zemis, but to interpret their silence. When sickness came, we asked if the ancestors were displeased. When the cassava failed, we asked what had been forgotten. Through song, trance, and firelight, I opened the door between our world and theirs. The zemis never lied, but they often spoke in riddles. It was my task to understand. Sometimes, they told us when to leave a place. Other times, they warned of enemies or dreams yet to be fulfilled. Through them, our people stayed balanced—between sky and earth, life and death.

** **

**More Than Stone**

To one who does not know, a zemi may look like just a carved face or a curious relic. But to us, they are part of the bloodline. They carry the names of those who planted the first conucos, who crossed the sea, who held the stars in their memory. A zemi remembers. A zemi teaches. A zemi sees. That is why we never discard one, never forget one, even if its face is worn or broken. Even fragments hold spirit.

** **

**The Spirit Endures**

Now I am old, and others will soon carry the fire. But I say this to you—wherever the wind stirs leaves, wherever the sea pulls at the shore, the zemis are watching. They do not belong only to one people, one island, one name. They came from the rivers, but they live in the caves and hills of every island touched by our canoes. If you listen closely, you may still hear them breathing. And if you speak to them with respect, they may answer.

 

 

**Trade Routes and Cultural Exchange - Told by Carib War Chief Maboya**

Before the pale men crossed the horizon, before the names of our islands were written in foreign tongues, the sea was already full of voices. We, the Kalinago, did not stay in one place, tied to a single hill or bay. The sea was our road, our breath, our teacher. It connected the islands like beads on a necklace, each one with its own flavor, its own song. We paddled from the shores of South America to the furthest northern islands, guided by memory, stars, and the shape of the waves. Our canoes left wakes not just of water—but of language, custom, and life.

** **

**Not Only War, But Words**

People remember us for our spears and our raids, but they forget we were also messengers and guests. There were times when we came with warriors, yes. But there were also times we came with gifts. Feathers from the rainforest birds of Guyana. Shell beads polished until they shone like moonlight. Cotton from cultivated fields. Bundles of cassava flour. Dried fish and smoked meat. We traded obsidian from the volcanic islands, red ochre for body paint, turtle shell for tools and ornament. These goods passed from hand to hand, from canoe to canoe, crossing hundreds of miles in cycles older than any village.

** **

**Exchange of Knowledge**

With goods came stories. When we landed in distant yucayeques, we shared tales of the sky, of storms, of omens. We told of distant islands where the ground shook, or where the people fished with singing stones. And we listened too. The Taino told us their myths, their histories, their harvest songs. Some words became part of our own tongue. Some chants we still sing, though their meanings now drift like leaves in the wind. In this way, the sea did not only carry bodies. It carried ideas.

** **

**The Marriages That Bound Islands**

Some of our exchanges were sealed not with beads, but with hands. A marriage between clans from two islands could end a feud, bind an alliance, or open a new trade path. A Kalinago woman might marry into a Taino village and teach her children to speak both ways. A Taino man might join a Kalinago canoe party and never return to his homeland. These were not acts of conquest—they were bridges. Through marriage, the islands spoke to each other. Through kinship, peace could hold, even when war had touched the past.

** **

**Mainland Ties and River Gifts**

We did not forget the rivers. Our roots were in the Orinoco and the Amazon. Canoes still traveled south to trade with the Arawak and other forest peoples. They gave us plant medicine, new canoe designs, sacred chants, and seeds that grew better in wind-beaten soil. We returned with turtle shell armor, dried fruit, and stories of the sea. These ties to the mainland reminded us who we were—never alone, always part of something wider and older.

** **

**The Flow of Spirit and Power**

Not all trade was equal. Some villages grew powerful by controlling the flow of certain goods—salt, cotton, sacred tobacco. Others became known for hosting great gatherings, where chiefs met, gifts were exchanged, and dances lit up the night. In those moments, peace was stronger than war. Disputes were settled, alliances renewed, and the drums of the islands beat in rhythm. Even those we raided at times became our trade partners later. That is the way of island life—anger fades, but need and memory remain.

** **

**We Were Not Isolated**

Do not believe the lie that we were scattered people, forgotten in the sea. We were part of a living chain, each island a pulse in a greater heartbeat. Our canoes carved the paths. Our voices filled the wind. We did not wait for the world to find us—we found each other first. And in doing so, we built something stronger than any one village. We built a network of people who knew how to live with the land, speak with the sea, and walk between war and peace with wisdom. That is the world I fought to protect. That is the world you must remember.

 

 

**Social Structure Before the Taino Kingdoms - Told by Caonabo’s Elder**

Long before the great chiefs held court beneath carved zemis and warriors marched under banners, our people lived in smaller clusters—like scattered fires across the land. We lived in yucayeques of twenty, maybe thirty bohíos, ringed by forest, facing the river or sea. Each family had its place, each elder their voice. We had no kings then. Leadership was not held by a single man, but shared by those who had lived long, hunted well, or dreamed deep. Councils were formed by respect, not by force. Our leaders were chosen not for shouting, but for listening.

** **

**The Strength of the Clan**

We lived by clans—bloodlines carried through mothers, rooted in the womb and the hearth. Children belonged to the mother’s lineage, and her brothers stood as protectors, advisors, and storytellers. A man left his family to live in his wife’s village, joining her people, her customs, her soil. This kept peace between clans and allowed the land to breathe without too many footsteps. Within the clan, everyone had a place. No one ruled alone, and no one was cast out without reason. Elders guided, youths learned, and all were bound by the knowledge passed from voice to ear, fire to memory.

** **

**Harmony of Women and Men**

We did not divide power as others do. Women grew the food, managed the household, and guided the flow of daily life. They carried knowledge of the stars, the medicines, and the old songs. Men fished, built, and hunted, but they did not stand above the women. Our strength came from balance. The mother gave life, the father gave protection. The grandmother remembered what others forgot. A sister might guide a village with the same strength as a brother. This harmony shaped us, rooted us. Even the spirits honored both—the earth as mother, the sky as father.

** **

**The Role of the Bohíque**

Among us walked those who heard more than others—the bohíques, the spiritual leaders. They were dreamers, healers, and keepers of sacred knowledge. Neither fully man nor woman in their duty, they belonged to the spirit world more than to any one clan. When a child fell ill, the bohíque sang. When a crop failed, they listened to the zemis. When conflict stirred, they offered visions. They held no warriors, but their words could stop a spear. They were bridges, and through them, we remembered that the world seen and unseen must move together.

** **

**The Seeds of Hierarchy**

In time, as villages grew and trade routes stretched across the sea, some leaders rose higher than others. A hunter who brought in more food, a speaker whose voice calmed many camps, a woman whose garden fed three villages—these began to stand out. People sought their guidance, their judgment, their favor. Clans began to follow certain names, and those names became symbols of unity. From these seeds, the idea of the cacique was born—not a king, but a first among many. These early leaders still listened to council, still shared power. But they were the roots from which the great chiefdoms would later grow.

** **

**Why the Past Still Matters**

You see our world now and think it has always been ruled by great caciques, with gold on their arms and zemis in their plazas. But that came after. I remember when we were smaller, more scattered, and yet still whole. When every clan carried the wisdom of the land like water in a gourd—enough for their own needs, yet willing to share with others. It is good to have strong leaders, but never forget the path that led to them. They were shaped not by hunger for power, but by years of harmony, memory, and balance. That is the strength of our people. And that is what I, Caonabo’s elder, was born to remember.

 

 

**Food and Farming Innovations - Told by Chief Anacaona**

In my youth, I spent many days by the fireside with the women of my clan. There, beneath the thatched roof of my mother’s bohío, I learned that food is not only for the belly—it is for the spirit. The garden was our temple, the hearth our council, and the cassava griddle our altar. The men may have hunted, but it was the women who fed the village. We knew which roots to dig, which leaves to chew for healing, and how to coax life from the soil. The land does not give freely—it listens to the one who speaks gently. And it was the women who knew how to speak.

** **

**The Cassava Griddle and the Hidden Danger**

Cassava was our lifeblood, but she is not a forgiving plant. Her roots hold poison—an invisible danger that can sicken or kill if not prepared with care. Our mothers taught us to peel and grate the cassava, pressing the pulp in long woven sleeves called sebucans, twisting them until the deadly juice ran out. That juice we did not waste—we cooked it down into a bitter sauce. Then we dried the safe pulp on wide clay griddles over low fire, turning it until it became flatbread that could last for days. Each step was sacred. Each motion passed down from mother to daughter like a prayer.

** **

**The Rotating Gardens of Life**

We did not dig the same soil year after year. The earth tires if you do not let her rest. So we planted our conucos—raised mounds of soil—in one place, then moved them, letting the land breathe and renew. These mounds kept the water from pooling, protected the roots from rot, and softened the hard sun. In these mounds, we grew cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, peppers, beans, and maize. We planted them together, so they could help one another. Some climbed, some spread wide, some burrowed deep. Just like our people, they thrived in unity.

** **

**Food Woven Into Ceremony**

No feast, no song, no areyto was complete without food. We honored the spirits with roasted fish, grilled plantains, and bowls of fruit. We offered cassava bread to the zemis before we ate it ourselves. In weddings, women served food to bind the families. In mourning, they fed the mourners so grief would not weaken them. Children learned stories while shelling beans or grinding maize. Every bite carried meaning. Every meal reminded us that we are part of the land, and the land is part of us.

** **

**Survival in Story**

When drought came or storms tore the gardens apart, it was not the warriors who saved us. It was the knowledge of the women. They remembered which fruits ripened in the dry season, where the wild roots grew, which leaves cured a bad stomach. They had songs for when to plant and when to wait. Stories were told about greedy farmers who took too much and were punished, and about wise sisters who shared their seeds and were blessed. These stories were not just tales—they were instructions for living.

** **

**The Garden as a Gift**

I have walked many gardens in my life. I have seen fields as wide as rivers and plots so small they could fit in your arms. But in each, I saw the same thing—a promise between earth and hand. Our people never took more than we needed. We planted not just for today, but for tomorrow. And we taught our children that to eat is not just to survive—it is to remember, to honor, and to belong.

** **

**The Spirit in the Soil**

I am Anacaona, and I carry the songs of the women who shaped me. The warriors may guard the village, but the women feed it. The land does not yield its gifts to the careless. It opens only to those who listen, who learn, and who love it. Our food is not separate from our spirit—it is our spirit made visible. And in every griddle’s warmth, in every root pulled from the earth, the memory of our people grows strong again.

 

 

**Art and Expression - Told by Chief Anacaona**

Before there were areytos, before our feet pounded rhythms into the earth or our voices rose beneath the stars, our people spoke through their hands. They shaped the first songs in clay, not sound. I have held pots that were made before my grandmother’s grandmother was born—smooth, painted with spirals and symbols, colored with the fire of earth and spirit. These pots were not silent. They carried prayers for rain, for safe travel, for long life. Each design told a story. A swirl for water. A jaguar’s claw for power. A spiral for the sun’s never-ending journey. These were not decorations—they were memories, held in the curve of a bowl or the rim of a vessel.

** **

**Carving Memory into Stone**

As time moved forward, so did our voices. We began to carve stone—not just for tools, but for meaning. I have seen zemis carved from polished black rock, their eyes wide and unblinking, their mouths open as if mid-chant. Some of these spirits guard our sacred caves, while others sit in the corners of our bohíos, watching over our sleep. We carved with coral, bone, and sharpened shell, each mark deliberate, each figure a bridge between worlds. The stones remembered even when mouths forgot. And so we honored them.

** **

**The Dance of the Areyto**

When I was a child, I learned that a story is not only words. It is movement. It is breath. It is the sway of hips, the stomp of feet, the echo of hands clapping in rhythm with the wind. The areyto is more than a dance—it is our library. In it, we tell of migrations, of great storms, of heroes and betrayal, of how cassava was given to us by the gods. As a poet, I wove these stories with care. Each verse tied to a step, each word guiding the dancer’s body. We painted our skin with roucou, adorned our arms with feathers and shells, and let our voices rise with the drums. In the areyto, we became our ancestors, our children, our spirits.

** **

**Art as Offering and Bond**

We did not create only to please ourselves. Art was our offering. Before planting, we sang. Before war, we danced. Before eating, we painted the walls of our memory with symbols and chants. When two villages met in peace, we exchanged carved pendants or woven belts. When someone died, we etched their story onto a gourd or into the earth beside their bones. Through these acts, we remembered and were remembered. Our art stitched us together like the fibers of a net—each strand fragile, but together unbreakable.

** **

**Teaching Through Creation**

I have taught girls to shape clay as they listened to the wind outside. I have sat beside boys learning to drum as they watched the moon rise. I told them that art is not a game—it is a duty. It carries the soul of the people. To create is to remember. To express is to protect. Whether it is a song, a carving, a bowl, or a dance, each act becomes a vessel of truth. When we lose these, we lose our voice.

** **

**We Are Still Singing**

Even now, as the winds grow strange and new ships appear beyond the sea, I still sing. I still dance. I still carve with my words. For I know that as long as one voice remains to speak, as long as one hand rises to paint or shape, we are not forgotten. Our art lives. Our stories breathe. And through them, we remain rooted in the land, reaching for the sky. I am Anacaona, daughter of poets, sister to stone, mother of memory. And I offer this to you—not as a gift, but as a responsibility. Learn our songs. Shape our stories. And carry them onward.

 

 

**Winds of Change: New Arrivals and Rising Complexity - Told by Chief Anacaona, Carib War Chief Maboya, Yma Sumac’s Ancestor, and Caonabo’s Elder**

**Signs in the River and SkyYma Sumac’s Ancestor:*** Long before the great canoes of gold and war, I felt the earth breathe differently. The river no longer sang with the same voice. The birds flew strange paths, and the stars—my oldest teachers—shifted in patterns that made even the jaguar pause. I dreamed of islands with many fires, voices rising in languages not yet born. The spirits whispered that more were coming, not from distant lands, but from deep roots that had yet to flower. They spoke of balance tipping, of ancestors preparing to return in new forms. I told my people the truth, though few listened. Greatness was coming, yes—but it would demand sacrifice, choice, and a deeper remembering of who we once were. The zemis stirred in the stone. The sea waited to carry more than trade. I saw it all—shadows of kingdoms in the light of fire*

*.*

**From Many Fires to a Single FlameCaonabo’s Elder:*** In my youth, we were many. Many clans, many villages, each guarding its own stories, carving its own path. But as the yucayeques grew, as the trails between them deepened into roads, something changed. We began to look beyond our own fires. Chiefs who once ruled only a few hills began speaking for valleys. Ceremonies brought distant clans together. Marriage, trade, conflict—they all pulled us into a larger circle. I remember when Caonabo's father met with a rival not to fight, but to join their names. That was new. We had always had leaders, but now we were shaping nations. I saw it begin, the shift from scattered kin to united chiefdoms. The past, which once lived in fragments, now braided itself into something stronger. The seeds of the kingdoms were sown long ago—in stories, in trade, in memory. Now, they were sprouting.*

* *

**Storm at the Edge of the HorizonCarib War Chief Maboya:*** The sea was growing louder. Not with waves, but with voices. We, the Kalinago, could feel it in our bones. The Taino lands to the north were growing bold. Their villages larger, their leaders prouder, their boats heavier with trade and tribute. We watched them build and spread like fire across dry grass. And we met them not only with open hands, but sharpened spears. There was peace sometimes, but never trust. Raids became more frequent. Words grew sharper. Border islands changed hands in the night. We took captives, they claimed honor. But beneath it all, I felt the shift—this was not just rivalry. It was the beginning of a struggle for the sea itself. The islands no longer belonged to small clans. They were being claimed by giants, rising with new voices and unfamiliar power. We would not bow, but we would have to fight harder to remain.*

** **

**The Threshold of GreatnessChief Anacaona:*** When I was a girl, I stood on the edge of something I could not yet name. Our people—my Taino—had grown wise, beautiful, strong. Our zemis stood tall in the plazas. Our ball courts rang with song and footsteps. Our women wove tales as easily as they wove hammocks. The gardens fed not just bellies, but souls. We were more than a village—we were a nation of nations, woven by shared stories, balanced by respect and memory. And yet, we still held the gentleness of the past in our hands. We had not yet been hardened by conquest. We were open, still learning to shape greatness with care. I believed we were ready to lead—not just to rule, but to guide these islands with beauty and wisdom. We stood poised, like dancers waiting for the drum to begin. The kingdoms were rising. And I, Anacaona, felt the drumbeat in my chest.*

 

**The Breath Before the Storm**

From the south came the omens. From the center came the unity. From the east came the challenge. From the west came the hope. The Caribbean was no longer a scattering of voices—it was becoming a chorus. But every chorus must choose its rhythm. In that moment before the storm, we each saw the shape of the future. Some feared it. Some fought it. Some welcomed it. And some, like me, tried to sing it into something worthy of remembrance. The winds were changing. And we were becoming something more.
