**My Name is Ahmose-Nefertari: Queen and Matriarch of Egypt**

I was born a princess of Egypt, daughter of Pharaoh Seqenenre Tao and Queen Ahhotep. My childhood was not one of peace and calm but of war and struggle. Our land was divided, and the foreign Hyksos held dominion over the northern lands. From an early age, I learned the burden of leadership and the weight of responsibility, for my family carried the hopes of Egypt’s freedom.

** **

**Marriage to Ahmose I**

I was wed to my brother, Ahmose I, the one destined to drive out the Hyksos and restore Egypt’s greatness. As his Great Royal Wife, I stood beside him during the battles that would unite our nation once again. The war was brutal and long, but through courage, strategy, and the will of the gods, we reclaimed our land. Together we began the rebuilding of Egypt, restoring temples, cities, and the sacred balance of Ma’at.

** **

**Mother and Regent**

When Ahmose I passed from this world, I became the protector of our lineage. As Queen Mother, I guided my son Amenhotep I, ensuring the dynasty remained strong. My role as regent was not simply ceremonial; I was revered and held immense influence, ensuring stability in a time when Egypt could have fallen into uncertainty. I became not just a queen, but a matriarch whose wisdom and presence shaped the course of the 18th Dynasty.

** **

**Revered as a Goddess**

In life, I was honored as the mother of the dynasty, but in death, I was worshiped as a goddess. My people believed I embodied eternal strength and divine favor. Shrines were built in my name, and generations after my passing still spoke of me with reverence. They saw me as the guardian of Thebes and a protector of my descendants who would carry Egypt into its golden age.

 

**My Legacy**

My life was one of war, of rebuilding, and of unshakable devotion to Egypt. Through my husband’s victories, my guidance as queen, and my protection of my son’s rule, I ensured that our dynasty would flourish. Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, who would come generations after me, built upon the foundations laid during my lifetime. My name, Ahmose-Nefertari, endures as more than a queen’s title—it endures as a symbol of resilience, motherhood, and the strength of Egypt itself.

 

 

**The Rise of the 18th Dynasty – Told by Ahmose-Nefertari**

When I was young, Egypt was divided. The Hyksos, foreigners from the north, had seized the Delta and ruled it with their strange ways and foreign gods. My family, based in Thebes, never accepted this. My father and brothers fought tirelessly to push them out, but it was my husband, Ahmose I, who finally broke their hold. Through fierce battles, sieges, and relentless campaigns, he drove the Hyksos from our land and pursued them into Canaan, ensuring they would never again threaten Egypt.

** **

**The Reunification of Egypt**

With the Hyksos gone, Egypt was whole once more. The two lands, Upper and Lower Egypt, were reunited under native rule, and with that unity came strength. My husband rebuilt the government and restored the temples that had been desecrated. Together, we brought back the rituals that honored the gods, for we knew the favor of the divine was essential to Egypt’s prosperity. The wounds of foreign occupation were deep, but we worked to heal them through faith, order, and the rebuilding of our nation.

** **

**The Foundation of a New Dynasty**

Our victory marked the beginning of the 18th Dynasty, a new chapter in Egypt’s long history. This dynasty would become one of the greatest, known for wealth, conquest, and monumental achievements. I myself was honored not only as queen but as a symbol of this new age. The people revered me, and in time, I was deified as a goddess, a protector of Thebes and a mother of the dynasty.

** **

**The Legacy for Future Pharaohs**

What we began laid the path for those who came after us. Hatshepsut would one day rise as Pharaoh, building monuments and opening trade routes that enriched Egypt. Thutmose III would follow, leading armies to distant lands and making Egypt the heart of an empire. Their greatness was possible because of the foundation built in my lifetime, when Egypt was freed from foreign rule and reborn as a united and powerful kingdom.

 

 

**Royal Bloodlines and Succession – Told by Ahmose-Nefertari**

In Egypt, the throne was not merely taken by strength; it was secured by the purity of blood and the blessing of the gods. Our people believed that the royal line carried divine essence, passed down through generations to ensure that Pharaoh remained a living embodiment of the gods. This is why marriages were often arranged within the royal family itself, uniting brother and sister, or half-siblings, so that the sacred line would not be broken by outsiders.

** **

**My Role in Securing Legitimacy**

As Great Royal Wife of Ahmose I, I helped ensure that the bloodline remained strong. Together, we tied the future of Egypt to both the divine and the earthly family line. My children were not just heirs; they were symbols of continuity, carrying the power of two royal parents into the future. It was this devotion to dynastic purity that gave our family authority to rule long after the chaos of the Hyksos had ended.

** **

**Marriage and Political Strategy**

Dynastic marriages were not simply matters of the heart; they were acts of strategy. By marrying within the royal house, Pharaohs ensured that no rival family could claim legitimacy through birth. When Thutmose I wed Queen Ahmose, and later when his daughter Hatshepsut married her half-brother Thutmose II, these unions were deliberate moves to secure the throne and silence challenges to succession.

** **

**The Unusual Rise of Hatshepsut**

Hatshepsut’s ascent to Pharaoh was extraordinary because she was a woman, but her bloodline made it possible. As the daughter of Thutmose I and Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, her position was beyond question. She carried both the royal blood and the divine favor that Egypt demanded of a ruler. Without such lineage, her claim could never have been accepted. Though she had to fight for recognition, her heritage gave her the foundation she needed to take the throne and rule in her own right.

** **

**The Legacy of Dynastic Legitimacy**

These marriages and unions, sometimes difficult to understand by those beyond our time, were the bedrock of Egypt’s order. They ensured that Pharaoh’s power was unquestioned, flowing from a line both human and divine. It was this tradition that allowed our dynasty to flourish, and it explains how even unusual circumstances, like the rise of Hatshepsut, fit within the eternal pattern of Egyptian kingship.

 

 

**My Name is Hatshepsut: Pharaoh of Egypt**

I was born the daughter of Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose, raised in the royal court of Egypt where I was educated in the ways of leadership, religion, and statecraft. From my earliest years, I learned the rituals of the temple and the responsibilities of kingship, though no one imagined then that I, a woman, would one day sit upon the throne of Egypt as Pharaoh.

** **

**Marriage and Queenship**

I was married to my half-brother, Thutmose II, as was the tradition of our bloodline. As his Great Royal Wife, I served Egypt faithfully, performing religious duties and supporting his reign. When he died young, leaving behind a son, Thutmose III, born to a secondary wife, I found myself at the center of Egypt’s future.

** **

**Regency and Rising Power**

At first, I ruled as regent for the young Thutmose III, guiding Egypt while he was still a child. Yet, as the years passed, I stepped beyond the shadows of regency. I declared myself Pharaoh, not merely queen, and took on the symbols and titles of kingship. I wore the false beard, the headdress, and the regalia of a male ruler, for Egypt had never known a woman king.

** **

**My Achievements as Pharaoh**

My reign was marked not by endless wars but by prosperity, trade, and magnificent building projects. I sent great expeditions to the land of Punt, bringing back incense, gold, ivory, and exotic treasures that enriched Egypt. I commanded the building of temples, most notably my glorious mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, where terraces rise against the cliffs of Thebes, a monument to my reign and my vision for Egypt.

** **

**Religion and Divine Legitimacy**

To secure my place as Pharaoh, I proclaimed that the god Amun himself had chosen me as ruler of Egypt. My inscriptions and monuments declared me the daughter of the divine, sent to uphold Ma’at, the balance of order and truth. Through devotion to the gods, I established my reign as rightful and everlasting.

** **

**The End of My Reign**

I ruled for more than two decades, a time of peace and stability for my people. When I passed, Thutmose III took sole command of the throne. In time, my name and image were struck from many monuments, perhaps to strengthen his own line or to erase the memory of a woman who had ruled as king. Yet erasure could not diminish my accomplishments.

** **

**My Legacy**

Though some tried to hide my memory, history remembers me as one of Egypt’s greatest rulers. I proved that a woman could sit upon the throne as Pharaoh, guiding Egypt with wisdom, ambition, and vision. My monuments still stand, my achievements still inspire, and my name endures as a symbol of strength and determination. I am Hatshepsut, Pharaoh of Egypt.

 

 

**The Childhood of Hatshepsut – Told by Hatshepsut**

I was born the daughter of Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose, at a time when Egypt was strong and flourishing. From my first days, I was surrounded by the grandeur of the palace and the rituals of the gods. Unlike most children, I was not raised simply as a daughter, but as one who might one day play an important role in the destiny of Egypt.

** **

**My Early Education**

My upbringing was filled with lessons meant to prepare me for service to both the crown and the gods. I learned to read and write, to study the sacred texts, and to perform religious rituals with precision. Priests and tutors taught me the ancient traditions of Ma’at, the balance that held our world together. My father wanted me to understand not just the beauty of Egypt, but the weight of responsibility that came with ruling it.

** **

**Religious Training**

From an early age, I was introduced to the worship of Amun, the great god of Thebes. I was initiated into temple duties, serving as a priestess before I was grown. This deepened my understanding of the divine order and gave me a strong bond with the priesthood, which would later prove essential to my reign. I was not raised in the shadows but in the light of the temples, learning how to move with authority among the gods and men alike.

** **

**Preparation for Power**

Even as a child, I knew that I was set apart. My father spoke openly of my worth and the strength I carried within me. Though few could imagine a woman one day taking the throne, I was trained with the confidence and knowledge that I might be called upon to lead. My education, my priestly duties, and my presence in the royal court all prepared me for the life that awaited me, even if I did not yet understand how extraordinary my journey would become.

** **

**The Seeds of Ambition**

In those years of my youth, I learned to value tradition, devotion, and the strength of the royal bloodline. The gods had given me a sharp mind and an unwavering spirit, and my family had given me the tools to use them. Though I was still only a girl, I felt the stirrings of ambition, a whisper that perhaps my path would lead beyond the role of queen, to something far greater.

 

 

**Marriage to Thutmose II – Told by Hatshepsut**

**The Union of Bloodlines**As was the tradition of our house, I was given in marriage to my half-brother, Thutmose II. He was the son of my father, Thutmose I, but born to a lesser wife, while I was the child of the Great Royal Wife. This union was not born of love alone but of duty, for such marriages preserved the royal bloodline and secured the legitimacy of the throne. Through our union, my place within the royal court was strengthened, and the continuity of our dynasty was assured.

** **

**My Role as Great Royal Wife**

As Thutmose II’s queen, I held the title of Great Royal Wife, the highest station a woman could achieve at court. It was my duty to perform sacred rituals, to stand beside the Pharaoh as he honored the gods, and to serve as the mother of heirs who would continue our line. In this role, I embodied both divine favor and royal authority, binding my husband’s reign to the will of the gods.

** **

**A Brief Reign**

Thutmose II’s reign was not long, and during his years as Pharaoh, I played a steadying role. His health was frail, and his strength did not match that of our father. In those years, I came to understand that my position as queen was not only ceremonial but vital for stability. I ensured that the court remained loyal and that the rituals of the temples were carried out without interruption.

 

**The Birth of an Heir**

From our union came Thutmose III, though not through me, but through another wife of lesser rank. Still, as Great Royal Wife, I held the authority to stand as his guardian and protector when my husband’s reign ended. This circumstance was unusual, but it positioned me to act in ways no woman had before, for I would soon hold the power not just as queen, but as regent, and later, as Pharaoh in my own right.

** **

**The Path Ahead**

My marriage to Thutmose II was both a fulfillment of tradition and the first step toward a destiny far greater than either of us could have foreseen. His reign was short, and his death left Egypt vulnerable, but it also opened the door for me to rise beyond the expectations of a queen and take upon myself the mantle of kingship.

 

 

**The Birth and Youth of Thutmose III – Told by Ahmose-Nefertari**

Thutmose III was born not to the Great Royal Wife, but to a secondary wife of Pharaoh Thutmose II. This made his path to the throne more fragile than most, for though he carried the blood of kings, his mother’s station did not grant him immediate strength in the eyes of the court. In Egypt, legitimacy often came from the rank of one’s mother, and so the young prince stood vulnerable, overshadowed by others with closer ties to the great royal line.

** **

**A Prince Surrounded by Power**

Despite his mother’s lesser rank, Thutmose III was not overlooked. As the only son of Pharaoh Thutmose II, he remained the rightful heir. Yet his youth was marked by uncertainty, for when his father passed, he was still but a child. Hatshepsut, both his stepmother and his aunt, held the position of Great Royal Wife and quickly rose to act as regent in his stead. Thus, the boy who was king in name found himself under the shadow of a woman who grew ever stronger.

 

**Education and Training**

Though young, Thutmose III was not left idle. He was placed in the army, where he learned the discipline of soldiers and the ways of war. He trained with weapons, marched with men, and studied the strategies of Egypt’s generals. Unlike many princes who grew soft in the luxury of the palace, this boy became hardened by military life. The court may have doubted his strength, but the barracks and training grounds shaped him into a warrior destined to lead.

** **

**The Seeds of Greatness**

I looked upon the boy and saw a spark within him that others may not have noticed. Though his childhood was overshadowed by Hatshepsut’s growing power, the trials of his youth prepared him for the challenges to come. His uncertain position forced him to grow shrewd, his training made him strong, and his patience taught him endurance. The world would one day know him not as a vulnerable child of secondary birth, but as a Pharaoh whose conquests would carry Egypt to the very edges of the known world.

 

 

**Regency for the Young King – Told by Hatshepsut**

When my husband, Thutmose II, passed from this world, his son Thutmose III was still a child, far too young to rule a kingdom as vast and powerful as Egypt. As Great Royal Wife and daughter of Thutmose I, I was the natural choice to guide the throne until he came of age. I stepped into the role of regent, carrying both the weight of my lineage and the responsibility to protect the legacy of the 18th Dynasty.

** **

**Guardian of the Throne**

At first, I ruled in his name, ensuring that the temples were supplied, the officials loyal, and the people secure. I stood before the gods in the sacred rituals, fulfilling the duties that the boy could not yet perform. Egypt looked to me for leadership, and I gave it stability in uncertain days. Though my role was meant to be temporary, my presence became essential, for I had the knowledge and authority to keep the Two Lands united.

 

**Gradual Transformation**

As time passed, I did not remain content to rule quietly in the background. The court, the priests, and the people came to see me not only as regent but as a ruler in my own right. I took on more titles, presided over more ceremonies, and began to shape Egypt’s destiny with my own hand. Thutmose III was still the heir, yet my authority grew to match his. Together, we were spoken of not as regent and king, but as co-rulers.

** **

**The Seeds of My Kingship**

The more I ruled, the more I realized that my place was not meant to end when the boy came of age. I had the blood of Pharaohs, the support of the priests, and the wisdom to lead. The gods themselves, I proclaimed, had chosen me for this role. The regency, which began as a duty of care, became the path to kingship. In time, I would no longer be content with the title of regent, for Egypt needed more than a guardian—it needed a Pharaoh, and I was ready to answer that call.

 

 

**Proclamation as Pharaoh – Told by Hatshepsut**

The years of my regency made clear that Egypt needed more than a caretaker. The people looked to me for strength, the priests of Amun proclaimed my favor, and the gods themselves spoke through oracles of my destiny. Thutmose III was still young, and though he bore the blood of kings, he was not yet ready to shoulder the burdens of empire. I knew then that I must rise beyond the role of regent. I would no longer act in another’s name—I would take the throne for myself.

** **

**The Day of Proclamation**

When the time came, I stood before the court in full regalia, not as queen, but as Pharaoh. I donned the false beard, the headdress, and the kilt of kingship, the same symbols worn by the men who came before me. Some may have whispered against it, but the sight of me in the attire of a king silenced doubt. I was not presenting myself as a woman reaching beyond her place—I was presenting myself as Pharaoh, chosen by the gods, rightful ruler of Egypt.

** **

**The Justification of the Gods**

To strengthen my claim, I declared that Amun, lord of Thebes, was my true father. The priests inscribed stories upon the walls of temples, telling how the god himself had come to my mother and begotten me. I proclaimed that I was not merely Pharaoh by bloodline but Pharaoh by divine decree. With the favor of Amun, no one could deny my right to sit upon the throne of the Two Lands.

** **

**The Transformation of Identity**

From that day forward, I was no longer spoken of as Great Royal Wife or Regent. I was Pharaoh Hatshepsut, King of Upper and Lower Egypt. Though I was a woman, my titles, regalia, and inscriptions spoke of me as a man, for kingship in Egypt carried no space for female weakness. Yet I was not hiding my womanhood—I was proving that the essence of kingship transcended the body.

 

**The Beginning of My Reign**

With my proclamation, I secured Egypt’s future. The boy Thutmose III still stood beside me, but I was the one who ruled. From this bold act sprang a reign of stability, wealth, and splendor, a reign that would stand among the greatest of the 18th Dynasty. The day I took the throne was not only the moment of my own transformation but the moment when Egypt was set on a path toward glory.

 

 

**My Name is Senemut: Architect and Servant of the Pharaoh**

I was not born into nobility, nor was I destined by birth to stand among the powerful. I came from a modest family, raised with the values of hard work and loyalty. Yet, I was gifted with a sharp mind and a talent for numbers, planning, and design. These skills brought me into the service of the royal court, where I would rise to hold positions of great trust under Pharaoh Hatshepsut.

** **

**My Rise in the Court**

Through diligence and ability, I caught the attention of the queen herself. Hatshepsut placed her confidence in me, granting me roles as tutor to her daughter Neferure and as overseer of royal projects. It was a rare honor for a man of humble origins to climb so high, but my loyalty and skill ensured that I became one of her most trusted advisors.

** **

**Architect of Monuments**

I am most remembered for my work as an architect. I designed and oversaw many of Hatshepsut’s grand projects, including her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, a creation of terraces, columns, and sanctuaries carved into the cliffs of Thebes. It was more than a temple; it was a statement of her power and legitimacy as Pharaoh, and I was proud to bring her vision to life.

** **

**Service to Hatshepsut**

I served Hatshepsut not only as an architect but as a steward of her rule. I helped craft the imagery and inscriptions that declared her chosen by Amun, shaping the narrative that secured her reign. Some whispered of a bond between us deeper than service, though such things were never spoken openly. What is certain is that my devotion to her and her reign was unwavering.

** **

**My Later Years**

As Thutmose III grew into his power, my prominence faded. The monuments I had helped to create became targets of erasure, and even my tomb was left unfinished. Yet the stone of Deir el-Bahri still speaks of my labor, and the very walls of that temple carry the legacy of what I built.

** **

**My Legacy**

Though I was not Pharaoh, my name lives on beside hers, for I shaped the monuments that told her story. My life is proof that even one born of humble beginnings can rise through service, skill, and loyalty to stand among the makers of history. I am Senemut, architect and servant of the Pharaoh, and though time has tried to silence me, the stone remembers.

 

 

**Religious Legitimacy and Amun’s Support – Told by Senemut**

In Egypt, no ruler could sit upon the throne without the blessing of the gods. Power did not rest on bloodline alone but on divine favor, and every Pharaoh had to show that the gods had chosen them. When Hatshepsut proclaimed herself Pharaoh, this truth became even more vital, for she was a woman stepping into a role long reserved for men. To secure her reign, we turned to the mightiest of the gods, Amun of Thebes, whose voice could silence all doubt.

** **

**The Story of Divine Birth**

We carved upon temple walls the story of Hatshepsut’s conception, not as the daughter of Thutmose I alone, but as the child of Amun himself. In the inscriptions, Amun descended to her mother, Queen Ahmose, taking the form of her husband and planting the seed of a divine heir. From this union came Hatshepsut, not merely royal by blood, but god-born. These tales were not simple fables but sacred declarations, ensuring that all Egypt saw her kingship as destined by heaven.

** **

**The Oracles of Amun**

It was not only the stories of her birth that gave her strength, but also the oracles. Priests carried the barque of Amun during ceremonies, and the god was said to nod in approval when asked if Hatshepsut was chosen to rule. Such divine affirmations were powerful beyond any mortal claim. The people believed that Amun himself had lifted her above all others, placing the crook and flail into her hands.

** **

**The Temples of Thebes**

To cement her bond with the god, Hatshepsut lavished gifts upon his temples. She rebuilt and expanded sanctuaries, ensuring Amun’s name was honored across the land. Her devotion was displayed in every stone, her offerings rich and plentiful. In return, the priests gave her their loyalty, spreading the message that her reign was holy and just.

** **

**The Power of Belief**

Through these stories, oracles, and offerings, we shaped the vision of her reign. Hatshepsut was not an ambitious woman reaching for power—she was the chosen of Amun, his daughter and his servant, Pharaoh by divine command. In Egypt, faith and kingship were one, and with Amun’s support, her rule became unshakable. Even those who doubted were silenced, for to question her was to question the will of the god himself.

 

 

**Building Programs and Architecture – Told by Senemut**

Hatshepsut’s reign was not defined by conquest, but by creation. She sought to leave her mark upon Egypt not with battles, but with monuments that would speak for eternity. As her steward and architect, I was entrusted with this vision, to shape in stone the message of her reign. Each project was more than a building; it was a declaration of her legitimacy and her greatness as Pharaoh.

** **

**The Temple of Deir el-Bahri**

My greatest work was her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, built against the cliffs of western Thebes. Its terraces rose like steps to the heavens, connected by grand ramps, lined with statues, and filled with sanctuaries to the gods. Within its walls, we carved scenes of her divine birth and her great achievements, including the expedition to Punt. This temple was not only a place of worship but a monument to her reign, standing as proof that her rule was blessed by the gods and worthy of remembrance.

** **

**Other Monuments of Her Reign**

The temple at Deir el-Bahri was the jewel of her projects, but it was not alone. Hatshepsut ordered obelisks to be raised at Karnak, soaring pillars of red granite that reached to the sky, proclaiming her devotion to Amun. She restored temples across Egypt, honoring the gods and linking her name with their eternal power. Each stone laid in these temples told of her strength and her vision, weaving her presence into the sacred heart of Egypt.

** **

**Symbolism in Stone**

Every monument carried meaning. The terraces of Deir el-Bahri represented harmony and order. The obelisks pointed toward the sun, a symbol of eternal renewal. The reliefs told the story of a Pharaoh chosen by the gods, a woman who had taken on the role of king. In every block of stone, we placed her authority, making it unshakable by those who doubted.

** **

**A Legacy Carved in Time**

My work as her architect was not merely to build, but to give permanence to her reign. Wars can be forgotten, victories fade, but stone endures. Through these monuments, Hatshepsut’s name and image were secured for eternity. Though later rulers tried to erase her memory, the grandeur of her works survived, ensuring that Egypt—and the world—would always remember her as one of its greatest builders.

 

 

**Trade Expeditions to Punt – Told by Hatshepsut**

From the earliest days of my reign, I longed to restore Egypt’s ties with the fabled land of Punt. This distant place, reached by sea and river, was a source of riches beyond measure. Incense, myrrh, ebony, ivory, gold, and even exotic animals came from its shores. The tales of Punt had long inspired Pharaohs, but in the years before me, the route had been left unused. I saw it as both an opportunity and a divine calling to reopen this gateway of prosperity.

** **

**The Great Expedition**

I ordered a grand fleet to be built and filled with Egypt’s finest sailors, merchants, and soldiers. The ships were laden with goods to trade, and prayers were offered to the gods of the Nile and the sea for safe passage. They sailed down the Red Sea, following routes known to our ancestors, until at last they reached Punt, a land lush and foreign, yet bound to Egypt by ancient ties.

** **

**The Wealth of Punt**

The expedition returned with treasures that astonished the people of Thebes. Incense trees were brought back whole, planted in the gardens of my temple so that their fragrance would forever honor Amun. Myrrh and frankincense, used in sacred rituals, poured into the temples, filling the air with sweetness. Gold, ivory, and precious woods flowed into Egypt, enriching both the gods and the crown. Even exotic animals such as baboons and leopards were brought to delight the court and to show the wonders of distant lands.

** **

**The Record of Achievement**

I ensured that this triumph was recorded upon the walls of my temple at Deir el-Bahri. There, the reliefs show the ships of Egypt sailing proudly, the gifts of Punt displayed, and the people of that land offering tribute. These carvings were not only records but symbols of the reach of my power, proof that I could extend Egypt’s influence far beyond its borders without a sword being drawn.

** **

**The Legacy of Trade**

Through this expedition, I proved that prosperity could be won not only through war but through peace and exchange. The gods themselves were pleased, for the incense and myrrh were vital in their worship, strengthening the bond between Egypt and the divine. This journey to Punt became one of the greatest achievements of my reign, a lasting reminder that Egypt’s glory was built not just on conquest, but on vision and the wealth of distant horizons.

 

 

**Peace and Prosperity in Hatshepsut’s Egypt – Told by Senemut**

During the years of Hatshepsut’s rule, Egypt did not march endlessly into foreign lands with sword and shield. Instead, she chose a different path, one of peace and careful governance. Some may have doubted a Pharaoh who did not seek glory in battle, yet her wisdom proved that prosperity could come not from conquest but from stability. The Two Lands thrived under her steady hand, free from the exhaustion and bloodshed of constant war.

** **

**The Strength of Internal Development**

Hatshepsut devoted her energy to building Egypt from within. Fields were cultivated, trade routes restored, and temples raised in honor of the gods. The wealth brought by expeditions such as the one to Punt enriched the temples and the people, ensuring that Egypt’s strength did not falter. Roads and waterways were maintained, allowing goods and grain to move swiftly through the land. In this way, Egypt became strong not by expansion, but by nurturing its own heart.

** **

**Diplomacy and Respect**

Instead of sending armies, Hatshepsut extended Egypt’s influence through diplomacy. Neighboring lands respected her power and sent tribute, not out of fear, but out of recognition of Egypt’s prosperity. She showed that a Pharaoh could rule as a guardian of peace and still command respect beyond her borders. Her reign was a testament to the strength of Egypt’s reputation, which did not rely solely on the edge of a blade.

** **

**The Prosperity of the People**

The ordinary people of Egypt flourished in her time. Farmers saw their harvests protected, merchants traveled safely along the Nile, and craftsmen found work in the building of temples and monuments. There was food in the granaries, gold in the treasuries, and faith in the temples. This was an age when the gods were honored, the people secure, and the kingdom stable.

** **

**A Legacy of Stability**

Hatshepsut’s reign became known as a time of peace and abundance, a contrast to the wars that had preceded her and those that would follow. Though later Pharaohs won fame with their victories in battle, her legacy was written in the calm strength of Egypt itself. I saw with my own eyes how her vision of stability brought lasting prosperity, and it remains one of the greatest achievements of her time as Pharaoh.

 

 

**The Education of Thutmose III – Told by Ahmose-Nefertari**

While Hatshepsut ruled as Pharaoh, young Thutmose III grew up not at the center of the court but in its shadows. Though he was the rightful heir, the throne was held by his stepmother and aunt, and he could not yet claim his place. This circumstance shaped his youth, for he learned early the value of patience and the necessity of proving himself through deeds, not words.

** **

**The Discipline of the Army**

Instead of being sheltered in the palace, Thutmose was placed in the army, where he was trained with the sons of soldiers and nobles. There he learned to wield weapons, to ride chariots, and to command men. He grew hardened in body and spirit, developing the discipline that would one day make him one of Egypt’s greatest generals. The rigors of military life prepared him for the throne in a way that the luxury of court never could.

** **

**Lessons in Leadership**

Beyond the training of war, he was taught the arts of leadership. He studied strategy, listened to the wisdom of seasoned commanders, and watched how discipline turned a company of men into a force of power. The generals who trained him saw in him the spark of greatness, and he earned their respect not by birthright alone but by skill and determination.

** **

**Shaped by Waiting**

Living under Hatshepsut’s reign also gave him lessons in statecraft, even if from a distance. He watched as she strengthened Egypt through trade, building, and diplomacy. Though his path would be different, he learned the value of order and stability, and he saw how a ruler could secure loyalty through both vision and strength. The years of waiting were not wasted—they molded him into a man prepared to lead with wisdom as well as force.

** **

**Destined for Greatness**

By the time Thutmose III reached manhood, he was no longer the uncertain child of a secondary wife. He had become a warrior prince, tested by training and sharpened by patience. His education, both in the army and in the shadow of Hatshepsut’s rule, forged him into a leader who would one day rise above all others, carrying Egypt into an age of conquest and empire.

 

 

**My Name is Thutmose III: Pharaoh and Conqueror of Egypt**

I was born the son of Thutmose II and a lesser wife, not the Great Royal Wife. From the beginning, my path to the throne was not secure. When my father died, I was still a child, too young to rule. My stepmother and aunt, Hatshepsut, became my regent, guiding the kingdom while I was raised in the ways of war and leadership. Though I was the rightful heir, I spent my youth in the shadow of her growing power.

** **

**Years under Hatshepsut**

For years, Hatshepsut ruled not as regent but as Pharaoh. She wore the crowns, led the rituals, and commanded the loyalty of Egypt. I was trained as a warrior, serving in the army and learning the arts of strategy, discipline, and endurance. Though some may believe I resented her, I saw how her reign brought prosperity and stability to Egypt. Still, I waited for the day when I would take full command.

** **

**Taking the Throne**

When Hatshepsut died, I became the sole ruler of Egypt. By then I was a man seasoned in battle, eager to test my strength and expand Egypt’s influence. My reign stretched for more than fifty years, and it was during this time that I forged Egypt into the greatest empire the world had yet seen.

** **

**The Battle of Megiddo**

One of my greatest victories came at the Battle of Megiddo. My enemies gathered against me, certain they could break Egypt’s hold in Canaan. I chose a daring path through a narrow mountain pass, surprising my foes. My army surrounded them, and their retreat to the city turned into a siege. That victory broke their power and secured my reputation as a commander.

** **

**My Campaigns of Conquest**

I did not stop at Megiddo. Year after year, I marched north, crossing the Euphrates and reaching the lands of Mitanni. I led more campaigns than any Pharaoh before me, extending Egypt’s reach across Canaan, Syria, and into the heart of Mesopotamia. Princes of foreign lands bowed to me, sending tribute of gold, silver, horses, and captives. Egypt was no longer just a kingdom; it was an empire.

** **

**Wealth and Tribute**

The riches of my campaigns poured into Thebes. Temples were adorned with gold, and the treasuries swelled with wealth. Tribute from distant lands filled Egypt with foreign goods—cedar from Lebanon, lapis from Afghanistan, and spices from Asia. My conquests ensured that Egypt stood unmatched in power and prosperity.

** **

**Temples and the Gods**

Though I was a man of war, I was also a servant of the gods. I expanded temples, especially for Amun in Thebes, to honor the one who granted me victory. I built pylons, obelisks, and shrines so that my victories would be remembered not only in the songs of men but in the eyes of the gods themselves.

** **

**Erasing Hatshepsut**

In the later years of my reign, I ordered the removal of Hatshepsut’s name and images from many monuments. Some say it was revenge, others claim it was to secure the line of kingship for my descendants. Whatever the reason, I ensured that the record spoke of a continuous line of male Pharaohs. Yet even my efforts could not silence her memory forever.

** **

**My Legacy**

I ruled longer than most men live, and I left Egypt stronger than I found it. History has called me the “Napoleon of Egypt” for my many victories, but I was more than a conqueror. I was the ruler who turned Egypt into the center of the ancient world. My monuments still stand, my battles are still told, and my name endures as Thutmose III, Pharaoh and Conqueror of Egypt.

 

 

**Transition of Power After Hatshepsut’s Death – Told by Thutmose III**

**The End of Her Reign**

When Hatshepsut passed from this world, the throne of Egypt finally became mine alone. For many years, she had stood as Pharaoh, her authority unquestioned, her monuments rising proudly in Thebes. Though I had been king in name, my role had been limited, and I had learned to wait in silence. Her death brought not only the end of her reign but the opening of a path that had long been denied to me.

** **

**Taking Sole Command**

With her gone, I stepped forward without hesitation. I assumed full control of the throne, gathering the court, the priests, and the generals to my side. I had already earned the loyalty of the army through years of service and training, and now I united that loyalty with the authority of the crown. For the first time, Egypt had one clear ruler—myself—and I intended to leave no doubt of my strength.

** **

**The Weight of the Crown**

The transition was not simple. The memory of her reign lingered in every temple, every monument, every stone carved with her name. Many had grown accustomed to her rule, and I had to prove that Egypt’s future would be even greater under me. I carried the burden of not only honoring the gods and ruling the people but also showing that I could surpass the achievements of the woman who had stood before me as Pharaoh.

** **

**The Beginning of My Vision**

I resolved to lead Egypt into a new era, one defined not by peace and trade alone, but by conquest and empire. The years of waiting had sharpened me into a man of action, and now the throne gave me the power to fulfill my ambitions. My reign began with determination, for I would not be remembered as a shadow of another ruler. I would be remembered as the king who brought Egypt to the height of its power.

** **

**A New Chapter for Egypt**

The death of Hatshepsut was the turning of a page in Egypt’s history. From that moment forward, I was Pharaoh in truth as well as name, and I vowed that my reign would stretch farther and shine brighter than any who came before me. Her monuments might remain, but the future was mine to shape, and I would carve my legacy into the world through strength and conquest.

 

 

**Early Campaigns of Thutmose III – Told by Thutmose III**

When I took the throne in my own right, Egypt’s northern territories were restless. The princes of Canaan and Syria, who had once sworn loyalty, believed the years of Hatshepsut’s peaceful rule had weakened Egypt. They whispered rebellion and gathered allies, hoping to throw off our control. I knew that if I did not act quickly, Egypt’s empire would crumble before it had even begun. Thus, I prepared my first campaigns to reassert our dominance.

** **

**March into Canaan**

I led my army north across the Sinai, through deserts and over rivers, until we reached the rebellious cities of Canaan. My soldiers, trained and disciplined, moved with swiftness and strength. We fought against fortified towns, breaking through their walls and seizing their supplies. Each victory sent a message that Egypt’s hand was strong and that disobedience would not be tolerated.

** **

**Securing Syria**

Beyond Canaan lay the lands of Syria, where princes believed distance would shield them from my wrath. They misjudged me. I pushed farther than many thought possible, taking my army deep into their lands. City after city bowed before us, offering tribute and hostages to prove their loyalty. Those who resisted were crushed swiftly, their walls torn down and their leaders taken in chains.

** **

**The Flow of Tribute**

From these campaigns, Egypt’s wealth grew. Timber from the mountains of Lebanon, horses from the northern plains, and metals from distant mines flowed into Thebes. Foreign princes sent their sons as hostages, raised in Egypt as both guests and guarantees of their fathers’ obedience. My victories were not only military triumphs—they were the foundation of a system that bound these lands to Egypt through fear, respect, and obligation.

 

**The Dawn of an Empire**

These first campaigns were but the beginning, yet they set the tone for my reign. Egypt was no longer a kingdom content within its borders—it was becoming an empire, feared and respected across the Near East. My early victories prepared the way for greater conquests yet to come, and they proved to all that the boy who had once lived in another’s shadow had now become the master of kings.

 

 

**The Battle of Megiddo (c. 1457 BC) – Told by Thutmose III**

The princes of Canaan, led by the ruler of Kadesh, believed they could defy Egypt and cast off our power. They gathered their forces in the stronghold of Megiddo, a city that commanded the mountain passes and the routes of trade. More than three hundred chariots and countless warriors awaited me there, certain that I would not dare to challenge them in such a position. Yet I knew that Egypt’s empire depended on this battle, and I would not turn back.

 

**The Daring March**

To reach Megiddo, there were three roads. Two were wide and safe, but heavily guarded by my enemies. The third, the road through the narrow pass of Aruna, was so tight that my army would have to march single file, vulnerable to ambush. My generals warned me against it, but I chose the daring path. I led my soldiers through the pass, and when we emerged, the enemy was unprepared. We appeared before Megiddo suddenly, taking the rebels by surprise.

** **

**The Clash of Armies**

The battle that followed shook the plain before the city. Chariots thundered, arrows darkened the sky, and the cries of warriors filled the air. I rode at the front with my soldiers, driving our enemies back step by step. The princes fought fiercely, but the discipline of Egypt’s army broke their lines. Panic spread among them, and soon they fled to the gates of Megiddo, abandoning their camp in chaos.

** **

**The Siege of the City**

The princes sealed themselves within the walls, hoping to outlast me. For seven months we surrounded Megiddo, cutting off their supplies and waiting as hunger and fear weakened their resolve. At last, they opened the gates and submitted. I showed them mercy, sparing their lives and taking their sons as hostages to ensure their loyalty. The victory was complete, not only in battle but in diplomacy.

** **

**The Legacy of Megiddo**

The Battle of Megiddo was the first great triumph of my reign, a victory that secured Egypt’s control over Canaan and Syria. The tribute of these lands flowed into Thebes, enriching our temples and treasuries. More than that, Megiddo showed the world that Egypt was led by a Pharaoh who would not hesitate, who would risk all for victory, and who would always prevail. From that day forward, I was no longer seen as a young king finding his place, but as a conqueror destined to expand Egypt’s empire to its greatest heights.

 

 

**Expansion of Egypt’s Empire – Told by Thutmose III**

The victory at Megiddo was only the beginning. Once the princes of Canaan were subdued, I turned my gaze farther north, to the lands of Syria and beyond, where powerful kingdoms still believed they could resist Egypt. Each year, I led my armies across the desert and mountains, striking deep into foreign lands. Campaign after campaign, I expanded Egypt’s reach, pushing the borders of our empire farther than any Pharaoh before me.

** **

**Crossing the Euphrates**

One of my proudest achievements was crossing the great Euphrates River, the lifeblood of distant Mesopotamia. There, I faced the kingdom of Mitanni, whose rulers sought to challenge Egypt’s power. With speed and precision, I struck their lands, capturing towns and scattering their warriors. No Pharaoh had ever carried Egypt’s banner so far east, and my soldiers marveled at the sight of foreign rivers and cities that had once seemed beyond our grasp.

** **

**The Tribute of Nations**

As Egypt’s power grew, kings and princes from across the Near East bowed before me. They sent tribute of gold, silver, copper, lapis, and horses, along with precious woods and strange animals. Their sons were given into my care as hostages, raised at my court to ensure their fathers’ loyalty. Egypt was no longer simply a kingdom of the Nile—it was the master of nations, commanding respect and obedience from the farthest corners of the known world.

** **

**A Network of Control**

I did not rule these lands only with force. I placed Egyptian garrisons in their cities, appointed governors to oversee them, and demanded regular tribute. Fortresses and supply depots were built along the routes of my campaigns, ensuring that Egypt’s power could reach swiftly wherever it was needed. Through this system, our empire remained strong, its foundation secured not only by war but by careful order and administration.

** **

**Egypt at its Height**

By the end of my campaigns, Egypt stood as the most powerful empire of its age. From the shores of the Mediterranean to the banks of the Euphrates, from Nubia in the south to Syria in the north, all lands knew the strength of my hand. My conquests filled the treasuries, enriched the temples, and secured the loyalty of foreign rulers. Under my reign, Egypt reached its greatest height, feared and respected by every nation around it.

 

 

**Wealth and Tribute from Conquered Lands – Told by Thutmose III**

With each victory, Egypt was showered with the wealth of foreign lands. Gold and silver, precious stones, and rare woods came from kingdoms that once defied us. My armies returned not only with the spoils of battle but with tribute offered by princes eager to prove their loyalty. These riches filled the treasuries of Thebes, and Egypt stood brighter and stronger than ever before.

** **

**Gifts of the Earth and Sea**

From Syria and Canaan came fine horses and skilled charioteers, whose knowledge strengthened our own armies. From Lebanon we received tall cedar trees, cut and floated down rivers to be used in our temples and ships. From distant lands came copper, tin, and exotic gems, carried by caravans to Egypt’s heart. Even the seas brought wonders—rare oils, spices, and dyes that made Egypt’s markets flourish.

** **

**Captives and Skilled Workers**

Along with riches, we brought back captives—prisoners of war who became servants, laborers, and craftsmen in Egypt. Many were skilled in arts unfamiliar to us, bringing new techniques in metalwork, weaving, and construction. They worked in the fields, on the monuments, and in the service of the crown, adding both strength and knowledge to our land.

** **

**Tribute for the Gods**

A great portion of this wealth was given to the temples, especially to Amun of Thebes. Golden vessels, incense, and jewels adorned his sanctuaries. The gods received the best of the tribute, ensuring their favor remained with me and with Egypt. By honoring them with foreign riches, I proved that Egypt’s empire was built not only by the sword but by the will of the divine.

** **

**The Prosperity of Egypt**

This flood of wealth transformed our kingdom. Farmers saw their tools improved with new metals, craftsmen found work in shaping foreign goods, and merchants thrived as trade expanded. The people of Egypt lived in a time of abundance, while the world beyond our borders looked to us with awe and envy. Through tribute, trade, and conquest, I made Egypt the wealthiest empire of its age, a shining jewel upon the Nile.

 

 

**Religious Reforms and Temples of Thutmose III – Told by Thutmose III**

All that I achieved in war and conquest, I owed to the gods, and above all to Amun of Thebes. His strength guided my armies, his will gave me victory, and his blessing secured my throne. It was not enough to claim success through my own power—I had to show Egypt and the world that Amun himself stood behind me. For this reason, I devoted much of the wealth and tribute gained in my campaigns to the god who had chosen me.

** **

**Expanding Karnak**

At Karnak, the great temple of Amun, I built halls, shrines, and towering pylons so that his house might outshine all others. I raised obelisks carved from red granite, their tips gilded to catch the light of the sun, proclaiming the bond between Pharaoh and the divine. I ordered walls covered with inscriptions of my victories, so that every visitor would see how the god favored me above all rulers of the earth. Karnak became not only the center of worship but the very heart of my empire.

** **

**Temples Across Egypt**

It was not in Thebes alone that I honored the gods. I commanded the building and restoration of temples across Egypt, from the Delta in the north to Nubia in the south. Each stone bore the message that Egypt’s strength came from the gods, and each sanctuary carried my name, tied forever to their glory. By restoring what had been neglected and raising new monuments, I secured the loyalty of both priest and people.

** **

**Religious Order and Reform**

I also worked to ensure that the priesthood remained strong and organized, for their support was vital to the throne. Offerings from the tribute of foreign lands poured into their hands—gold for their vessels, incense for their altars, cattle for their sacrifices. By enriching the temples, I enriched Egypt’s faith, binding together crown, priesthood, and people under the protection of the gods.

** **

**The Eternal Bond**

My devotion to Amun and the temples ensured that my reign was remembered not only as one of conquest but of piety. I showed that a Pharaoh’s duty was more than victory on the battlefield—it was to uphold Ma’at, the sacred order, through reverence for the divine. Long after my campaigns were over, the temples stood as a living record of my devotion, declaring that Thutmose III was not only a conqueror of men but a servant of the gods.

 

 

**Erasure of Hatshepsut’s Monuments – Told by Senemut**

After the death of my queen, Hatshepsut, a shadow fell over the monuments we had built together. Her name, once carved boldly into stone, was chiseled away. Her images, once proud and regal, were struck from the walls. The temples and obelisks that had been raised in her honor were altered to tell another story. This erasure was deliberate, carried out not by enemies from abroad but by her own successor, Thutmose III.

** **

**The Question of Revenge**

Some have said this act was born from resentment, that Thutmose, having lived in her shadow during his youth, sought to erase her memory out of bitterness. Perhaps he believed her claim to kingship had denied him his rightful place. Yet I do not see only anger in these actions. Time had already given him power, wealth, and conquest. Erasure of her memory was not needed to secure his greatness, which suggests something deeper.

** **

**The Politics of Succession**

Others believe it was an act of politics, meant to preserve the tradition of male kingship. For centuries, Pharaohs had been men, and the sight of a woman as king may have unsettled the order of succession. By removing her name, Thutmose may have wished to make it appear that the throne had passed directly from Thutmose II to himself, uninterrupted and unchallenged. This would strengthen his line, giving his descendants a clearer claim to the throne.

** **

**The Preservation of Order**

From Thutmose’s own perspective, this erasure may have been seen as restoring order. To him, Hatshepsut had ruled in an unusual and extraordinary way, one that might confuse future generations. By removing her, he presented a continuous line of kings, each man following the other, as tradition demanded. In this way, he may have believed he was protecting the crown and its eternal legacy.

** **

**A Debate That Endures**

Was it revenge, politics, or preservation of order? Perhaps it was all three. I, Senemut, who served her with loyalty, mourned the destruction of her legacy, for I knew her reign had brought peace and prosperity. Yet Thutmose may have believed his actions necessary for the stability of the dynasty. In the end, though her images were struck and her name defaced, her monuments remained, her story endured, and history has remembered her still as one of Egypt’s greatest Pharaohs.

 

 

**The Legacy of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III – Told by Ahmose-Nefertari**

In the story of Egypt, the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III stand as two sides of the same coin. Hatshepsut ruled with peace, stability, and vision, bringing prosperity through trade, building, and diplomacy. Thutmose III, in contrast, forged Egypt’s empire through war, conquest, and expansion. One built strength from within, the other projected power beyond our borders. Together, their reigns created a balance that raised Egypt to its golden age.

** **

**Hatshepsut’s Prosperity**

Hatshepsut proved that peace could be as powerful as war. She restored temples, strengthened the priesthood, and reopened trade routes long forgotten. Her expedition to Punt filled Egypt with treasures, incense, and wealth, enriching the temples of the gods. She left monuments that still stand as wonders of beauty and design, showing that her legacy was built not with weapons but with vision. Her reign gave Egypt the stability it needed to prepare for the glories that followed.

** **

**Thutmose III’s Empire**

Where Hatshepsut gave peace, Thutmose III gave conquest. He marched with his armies into Canaan, Syria, and beyond the Euphrates, defeating princes and kings who dared oppose him. Through his victories, Egypt became more than a kingdom of the Nile—it became the greatest empire of its time, feared and respected across the Near East. The wealth of tribute poured into Thebes, strengthening both crown and temple, and ensuring Egypt’s dominance for generations.

** **

**The Strength of Their Combined Legacy**

Though their reigns were different, they were not opposed—they were complementary. Hatshepsut’s years of stability laid the foundation for Thutmose’s conquests, and his victories secured and magnified what she had preserved. One gave Egypt the roots of prosperity, the other gave it wings of power. Together, they showed that greatness is not found in one path alone, but in the harmony of vision, wisdom, and strength.

** **

**The Golden Age of Egypt**

Because of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, Egypt stood at the height of its glory. The temples shone with riches, the armies marched victorious, and the Nile flowed through a land secure in its destiny. Their legacies, though different, joined to create a dynasty unmatched in power and prosperity. I, Ahmose-Nefertari, who saw the rise of this great line, know that their names will live forever, for they carried Egypt into an age that the world will never forget.
