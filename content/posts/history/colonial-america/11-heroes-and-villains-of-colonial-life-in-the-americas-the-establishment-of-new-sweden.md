**My Name is Johan Printz: Governor of New Sweden**

I was born in 1592 in Bottnaryd, Sweden, the son of a Lutheran minister. My youth was marked by study and discipline, though I was never a small man. My body grew large and heavy, earning me the nickname “Big Tub,” a title that would follow me throughout life. Despite my size, I was determined to make something of myself in both military and civil service.

** **

**Military and European Service**

In my early years I entered the army, serving during the tumultuous wars of Europe. I fought for Sweden in the Thirty Years’ War, learning not only the art of battle but also the heavy burdens of leadership. I also served as a courier and diplomat, moving between different courts and nations, always working for the interests of the Swedish Crown. These experiences prepared me for the great task that awaited me across the ocean.

** **

**Appointment to New Sweden**

In 1642, I was chosen to serve as governor of New Sweden, a colony on the banks of the Delaware River in North America. The Crown wished to secure Swedish influence in the New World and strengthen the fur trade. Though the journey across the Atlantic was dangerous, I accepted the responsibility with determination. I knew this would be no easy life, but it was an honor to be chosen.

** **

**Life in the New World**

When I arrived, I found the colony small and in need of strong leadership. I set about building new forts, strengthening defenses, and organizing trade with the Lenape and Susquehannock peoples. Under my command, we expanded Swedish control along the Delaware, and I made Fort Christina our stronghold. I ruled firmly, at times too firmly, for I demanded discipline and obedience from settlers who often resisted my authority.

** **

**Challenges and Struggles**

The land was harsh, and our resources were always stretched thin. Supplies from Sweden arrived slowly, and I often had to demand sacrifices from colonists. Conflicts with the Dutch and English also weighed heavily on us, for they coveted the same rivers and lands. My size made it difficult for me to travel far, and some saw me as overbearing, but I did all I could to keep New Sweden alive against overwhelming odds.

** **

**Return to Sweden**

By 1653, tensions had grown too strong, and I asked to be recalled. I returned to Sweden, leaving behind the colony that had both tested and defined me. I continued to serve in administrative roles until my death in 1663. Though my rule was not without fault, I believe I laid the foundation for a Swedish presence in America, one remembered even after the Dutch overtook us.

** **

**Legacy**

I am remembered as the great, heavy governor who tried to carve out a future for Sweden in the New World. My life was one of duty, service, and burden, and though New Sweden did not last, its influence remained in the culture and settlements of the Delaware Valley. I was Johan Printz, governor of New Sweden, and my story is bound to the hopes and struggles of a colony far from home.

**The Vision of New Sweden - Told by Johan Printz**

When the Crown of Sweden looked across the vast Atlantic, it saw an opportunity to join the great nations in building empires. The Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French had already planted their banners on distant shores. Sweden, too, sought a place among them. The vision of New Sweden was born from this desire—not merely to trade but to establish a colony that could stand as proof of our strength and ambition.

** **

**A Colony for Trade and Power**

The fur trade was the heart of our plan. The Delaware River and the lands surrounding it promised rich commerce in pelts, especially beaver, which were highly prized in Europe. But the vision went beyond trade alone. Our leaders believed that New Sweden could extend the influence of the Lutheran faith, provide land for settlers, and secure resources that would support the kingdom at home. It was a vision of both wealth and permanence.

** **

**The Choice of the Delaware River**

The decision to settle along the Delaware River was no accident. Its waters offered access deep into the land, where Native peoples lived and traded. It also placed us near the Dutch in New Netherland, which made our presence bold, perhaps even daring. By placing a fort there, we claimed not just the land but a voice in the struggle for control of the New World.

 

**Building Foundations for a Future**

The first settlers, soldiers, and builders came with determination. Fort Christina became the symbol of our presence, a wooden stronghold that guarded our foothold. The vision of New Sweden was not for a fleeting post but for a lasting home. We imagined families farming, churches rising, and trade flowing steadily across the ocean. Every log laid in the fort’s walls was a promise that we intended to stay.

** **

**Hopes and Challenges**

The vision was grand, but I knew from the beginning that challenges would test us. The land was new and strange to our people. Supplies were scarce, and we were surrounded by rivals far stronger than ourselves. Yet the vision of New Sweden gave us courage. It was not merely about survival but about leaving a legacy—that Sweden, too, could shape the destiny of the New World.

 

 

**My Name is Måns Kling: Commander of Fort Christina**

I was born in Finland in the early 1600s, when our land was part of the Swedish realm. Life there was not easy, for the winters were long and the land demanded hard work from every family. Like many Finns, I grew up learning to endure hardship and to rely on strength and determination. My upbringing prepared me for a life of service, both as a soldier and later as a leader in the New World.

** **

**Military Service under Sweden**

As a young man, I entered military service, fighting for the Swedish Crown during times of great conflict in Europe. I gained discipline and skill, and I learned the importance of loyalty and obedience. Soldiers like me were often asked to serve in distant places, and I was ready when the Crown looked toward the Americas.

** **

**Chosen for New Sweden**

In 1637, when plans were laid to establish a Swedish colony on the Delaware River, I was chosen to sail with the first settlers. I was not the governor, but I was trusted to lead and command. My orders were to oversee the construction of our first stronghold, Fort Christina. It was an enormous responsibility, for the success of the entire colony would depend on that fort’s security and strength.

 

**Building Fort Christina**

When we arrived, I immediately set men to work. Trees had to be cut, earth had to be moved, and defenses had to be built before the Dutch or English could challenge us. We built a palisade, bastions, and dwellings within the walls. It was grueling work, but we Finns were used to hard labor, and our experience with timber and cabins proved essential. I watched the fort rise from wilderness into a place of protection and order.

** **

**Relations with Native Peoples**

During those first years, we dealt often with the Lenape, who lived along the Delaware River. They were cautious but willing to trade, and I knew we needed peace if our small colony was to survive. We exchanged goods for land and furs, and I came to respect their knowledge of the land. Without their help, our hardships would have been far worse.

** **

**The Struggles of a Colony**

Life at Fort Christina was never easy. Supplies from Sweden were rare, and our numbers were too few to feel secure. Every day we balanced between survival and loss. Disease, hunger, and threats from rival colonies haunted us. Yet I took pride in knowing that our fort stood strong and that we had carved a Swedish presence on the Delaware.

** **

**Later Years**

My time as commander was not long, for others would come to govern and expand New Sweden. Still, I remained proud of my role in its earliest days. The colony faced many trials, and though it would one day fall to the Dutch, the mark of our settlement remained. My work at Fort Christina was my greatest legacy, for it gave Sweden its foothold in the New World.

** **

**Legacy**

I am remembered not as a grand governor but as a soldier and builder. It was my duty to lead men in creating the walls that sheltered our people, the stronghold from which New Sweden grew. I was Måns Kling, commander of Fort Christina, and my life was bound to the first steps of a colony far from our northern homeland.

 

 

**Choosing the Site for Fort Christina - Told by Måns Kling**

When our ships finally reached the shores of the Delaware River, I studied the land with the eyes of a soldier. The Crown had entrusted me to find a place where we could build a fort strong enough to protect our people and trade. The riverbanks stretched wide, the forests were thick with timber, and the air carried both promise and uncertainty.

** **

**The Importance of Water and Land**

The site needed more than beauty. It had to provide access to fresh water, fertile soil for crops, and the river itself for ships to come and go. We needed a location that could serve as both a harbor and a shield, a place where we could live and defend ourselves against rivals who might try to drive us out.

** **

**A Natural Defensive Position**

Near a rocky outcrop by the river’s bend, I saw what we needed. The land rose slightly, giving us a vantage point to watch the waters. Marshes and creeks nearby created natural barriers that would slow any enemy approach. With the forest behind us, we had timber for walls and houses. It was not only practical but strategic, a place where a small force like ours could stand firm.

 

**Respecting the Native Presence**

The Lenape lived along these waters, and I knew their presence mattered. They were willing to allow us a space here, for they saw in us new partners for trade. Choosing this site was not only about defense but about diplomacy. By building here, we placed ourselves where peace and commerce could flow.

** **

**The Beginning of Fort Christina**

Once I chose the site, the men began their work. Trees fell, earth was moved, and soon the outline of our new stronghold appeared. We named it Fort Christina, after our young queen in Sweden, a symbol of our loyalty and hope. The decision of where to build was mine, but the fort itself became the heart of New Sweden, the proof that our people had come to stay.

 

 

**Building Fort Christina (Architecture, Supplies, Labor) - Told by Måns Kling**

When the site was chosen, the true work began. I knew that a fort must rise quickly if we were to survive among powerful rivals. With the land surveyed, I marked out the walls and bastions. Every angle and line had to serve both defense and shelter, for this would be the heart of New Sweden.

** **

**The Timber of the Forest**

Our greatest resource was the forest itself. Tall trees surrounded us, and from them we cut the logs that became our palisades and dwellings. The Finns among us were skilled in building log structures, and their knowledge shaped the walls and cabins. Each log was not only timber but a promise of security for those who came so far from home.

** **

**The Architecture of Defense**

We built the fort in the shape of a square, with bastions at the corners. From these points, cannon could guard the river and fields. The walls were high enough to deter attackers and thick enough to withstand assault. Inside the palisade, we placed storehouses, a well, and quarters for the settlers. Every part was designed with defense in mind, for we knew the Dutch and English might one day come against us.

** **

**The Labor of Many Hands**

The work was backbreaking, and every man gave his strength. Soldiers became carpenters, and settlers became laborers. Even as hunger pressed us and the air grew heavy with exhaustion, the people labored on. Each swing of the axe, each stone laid, carried the hope that our colony would endure.

** **

**Supplies and Sacrifices**

We had brought tools, nails, and weapons from Sweden, but much of what we needed had to be fashioned here. Shortages forced us to make do, but necessity bred invention. We built with what the land gave us, adapting to its challenges. Our supplies were precious, and we wasted nothing, for every nail and plank had its value.

** **

**The Fort Completed**

At last, the fort stood. Its wooden walls, though simple, were strong and proud. We named it Fort Christina, after our queen, and it became not only a military post but a home for our people. To see it rise from wilderness into a place of protection was my greatest satisfaction. It was proof that New Sweden had a future, held firm by the hands of those who built it.

 

 

**My Name is Mattahorn: Chief of the Lenape People**

I was born among the Lenape, the people of the Delaware River valley. Our lives were shaped by the waters, the forests, and the seasons. We fished the rivers, hunted in the woods, and planted our corn, beans, and squash in the fields. From an early age, I learned that the chief’s duty was to guide his people, to keep peace within the village, and to protect our hunting grounds from outsiders.

** **

**The Coming of Strangers**

Long before I became chief, we heard stories of strange men crossing the great waters. The Dutch came first, and we traded furs for their goods. Metal tools, cloth, and guns were useful, but they brought trouble as well. Soon after, the Swedes arrived. Their ships anchored near our lands, and they spoke of building a fort at a place they called Christina.

** **

**Meeting the Swedes**

When I first met their leaders, I saw men both cautious and eager. They wanted land, and they wished for peace. I listened, for it was my responsibility to weigh every decision carefully. We agreed to allow them to build their fort, for in return they gave us tools, iron, and goods that made daily life easier. Yet I reminded my people that this friendship must never blind us to the danger of losing our lands.

** **

**Life Between Worlds**

As the years passed, I walked the narrow path between our ways and theirs. We still held our councils, hunted in the forests, and honored our traditions, but trade bound us to these newcomers. Some among my people welcomed the Swedes, while others feared that more strangers would come and take what was ours. My task was to keep balance, to ensure that our children would not go hungry and that our people would not lose their place.

** **

**Struggles and Losses**

The newcomers brought more than trade. They carried sicknesses that weakened our villages. They claimed more land, sometimes with words, sometimes with force. We were drawn into the struggles between Swedes, Dutch, and later the English. Each sought our alliance, but none truly understood that this was our homeland, not theirs to divide.

** **

**The Legacy of My People**

Though my life was filled with negotiation and struggle, I believe I served my people as best I could. The river still flows, and the memory of the Lenape remains in every tree and every hill along its banks. The forts of the Swedes may crumble, but the spirit of the Lenape endures.

** **

**My Story Remembered**

I am remembered not in their books but in the stories of my people. I was Mattahorn, a chief of the Lenape, and my life was bound to the time when strangers crossed the ocean and built their homes upon our land. I sought peace but also respect, so that the voice of the Lenape would not be silenced.

 

 

**Relations with the Lenape and Susquehannock Tribes - Told by Chief Mattahorn**

The Lenape have always lived along the great river that others came to call the Delaware. Its waters, forests, and fields sustained us for countless generations. When the Swedes arrived, they entered a land that was not empty but already filled with our villages and traditions. As chief, it was my responsibility to guide my people in meeting these newcomers, while also protecting what was ours.

** **

**First Encounters with the Swedes**

The Swedes were different from the Dutch before them. They came not only to trade but to build homes and a fort. When they sought permission to settle, we weighed their words carefully. We agreed to allow them land for their fort, for they offered iron, cloth, and tools in return. These things were useful to us, but I reminded my people that no gift could replace the river and forests that defined our lives.

** **

**Friendship with the Susquehannocks**

To the west lived the Susquehannocks, strong warriors who often clashed with the Iroquois. They, too, traded with the newcomers, seeking guns and goods to strengthen their power. At times, we Lenape and Susquehannocks stood together, for our interests aligned. At other times, we kept our distance, for alliances shifted like the flow of the river. The Swedes sought peace with both of our peoples, knowing that without us they could not survive.

** **

**Trade and Exchange**

The heart of our relations with the Swedes and Susquehannocks was trade. Beaver furs and pelts were plentiful in our lands, and the Europeans hungered for them. In return, they gave us metal pots, knives, axes, and guns. These tools changed our daily lives, making some tasks easier, but they also tied us to their ships and their hunger for more land.

** **

**Balancing Peace and Caution**

As chief, I urged peace, but I never forgot caution. The Dutch and English pressed from other directions, and the Swedes themselves grew bolder each season. The Susquehannocks, strong in war, often demanded more from the Swedes and their allies. We Lenape tried to keep the balance, trading where we could, avoiding war where possible, but always watching closely.

** **

**The Legacy of Relations**

The years of contact bound our peoples together in ways neither side could undo. Some Lenape saw opportunity, others saw danger, and both were true. The Swedes brought trade, faith, and friendship, but also the shadow of loss. For my people, the relations we forged with the Swedes and Susquehannocks were not simply alliances—they were a struggle to preserve our way of life while the world around us began to change.

 

 

**The Role of Finnish Settlers (Log Cabins, Survival Skills) - Told by Måns Kling**

Among the settlers who crossed the sea to New Sweden were many Finns. They came from a land of forests and hard winters, where survival demanded strength and resourcefulness. When they stepped onto the shores of the Delaware River, they brought with them not only their families but also skills that became the backbone of our survival.

** **

**The Log Cabin Tradition**

The most valuable gift the Finns carried was their knowledge of log building. In Finland, the forests provided endless timber, and the people had long perfected the art of fitting logs together tightly to make warm, sturdy homes. In the New World, where wood was plentiful, this skill was unmatched. Soon, the landscape of New Sweden was marked with log cabins, each one strong against wind, snow, and rain. These cabins became the model that spread across the colonies, adopted even by the English later on.

** **

**Adapting to the Wilderness**

The Finns were quick to adapt to the wilderness. They knew how to hunt, fish, and gather food, and they taught others how to endure in harsh conditions. Their experience in clearing forests and planting crops in difficult soils gave our colony the chance to survive. When supplies from Sweden failed to arrive, it was often the Finns’ resourcefulness that kept us alive.

** **

**Blending with the Land**

I often watched how the Finns worked with nature rather than against it. They chose sites for their cabins near water and timber, always planning for both shelter and sustenance. They shared their skills with Swedes and sometimes even with Native neighbors, creating bonds through labor and necessity. Their cabins were not grand, but they were lasting, and many stood for generations after their builders were gone.

** **

**A Lasting Contribution**

The role of the Finnish settlers was greater than many first realized. Without their skills, the colony might have failed in its first years. Their cabins gave us shelter, their knowledge gave us food, and their endurance gave us hope. Even after New Sweden was claimed by the Dutch, the log cabin remained as a symbol of our presence. It was the Finns who built not just homes but the foundation of survival in the New World.

 

 

**Religious Life in the Colony (Lutheranism and Churches) - Told by Johan Printz**

When we left Sweden, we did not only bring tools, weapons, and supplies. We carried with us the Lutheran faith, the foundation of our lives and our kingdom. The Crown and the Church both believed that our colony must reflect the order of our homeland, and that meant the worship of God according to the Lutheran way. Faith was as important to us as food or shelter.

** **

**The Role of the Church in New Sweden**

In the colony, the church was not just a place of prayer but the center of community life. It gave order to our days and reminded us of who we were, even in a strange land. Pastors traveled with us, and their sermons gave hope to settlers who struggled with hunger, disease, and the fear of the wilderness. In council and in daily work, the Word of God was a guide.

** **

**Building Places of Worship**

At first, our worship was held in simple cabins or outdoors under the sky. But soon, we built churches where settlers could gather in dignity to hear the Scriptures. These were modest buildings, made of timber like our homes, but they were set apart for holy use. The first such gathering place was near Fort Christina, a symbol that even on the edge of the world, we did not forget our devotion.

** **

**Maintaining Lutheran Order**

As governor, I made sure that our laws followed the principles of the Church and that no foreign teachings were allowed to weaken our unity. Discipline in faith was as important as discipline in work. I saw to it that the pastors had the authority they needed, and that every settler respected the Sabbath and the sacraments. Without unity in belief, I feared our colony would crumble under hardship and division.

** **

**Faith as Strength in Hardship**

Life in New Sweden was never easy. Yet, when food ran short or when fear of attack weighed heavily, it was often the gathering in worship that restored courage. Hymns sung in Swedish voices carried across the fort walls, reminding us that though we were far from home, God was still among us. The Church bound us together as one people, and in that unity we found the strength to endure.

 

 

**Swedish Military Organization in the New World - Told by Johan Printz**

From the very beginning, New Sweden was more than a place for settlers and farmers. It was a soldier’s colony, built to defend itself against the Dutch, the English, and any other threat that might come upon us. As governor, I was both civil leader and military commander, and I knew our survival depended on discipline, order, and readiness for war.

** **

**Fortifications and Defense**

Our first line of strength was our forts. Fort Christina stood as the heart of our defense, its bastions and palisades guarding the river and our settlers within. To strengthen our reach, I ordered new forts to be built along the Delaware, each placed where the river could be controlled and where rival ships would have to pass. These forts were not grand stone castles, but they were solid enough to stand against muskets and small cannon.

** **

**Organization of Soldiers**

The soldiers who came with us were few in number, but they were trained in the Swedish way of war. They carried muskets, swords, and pikes, and they drilled in formation so they could act with discipline if called into battle. I made certain that even settlers could be called to arms if needed, for in such a small colony every man had to bear responsibility for defense.

** **

**Weapons and Supplies**

Our supply of weapons and powder was always limited, and this made discipline even more important. Every musket ball, every measure of powder had to be counted and preserved. Cannon were placed in the bastions to guard the water, and watchmen stood ready to signal if ships appeared. Our strength was not in numbers but in vigilance.

 

**Maintaining Authority**

I ruled with a firm hand because I believed it necessary. Soldiers must obey their commanders, and settlers must follow orders when the colony was threatened. Some called me too harsh, but without obedience, the forts would crumble, and the enemy would take our lands. Military order was the backbone of New Sweden, and without it we would have been swept away long before our time.

** **

**The Spirit of Readiness**

Though we were far from the battlefields of Europe, I never let our men forget that they served the Swedish Crown. We were a small outpost of a great kingdom, and our forts and soldiers stood as proof of Sweden’s claim. In the New World, our military organization gave us both pride and protection, a reminder that even in a wilderness, we carried the discipline of our homeland.

 

 

**Trade with Native Peoples (Furs, Wampum, Goods) - Told by Chief Mattahorn**

When the Swedes arrived in our lands, their ships were filled with goods we had never seen before. They brought iron axes, knives, kettles, cloth, and guns. To them, these items were simple trade goods, but to us they held great value. In return, they sought our furs, especially beaver, which were plentiful in our streams and forests. These first exchanges bound us together, for both sides saw profit in the trade.

** **

**The Value of Furs and Wampum**

The Swedes prized beaver pelts above all, for they were in great demand across the ocean. But trade was not only in furs. Wampum, the strings of beads made from shells, carried deep meaning for our people and served as a sign of agreement and alliance. The Europeans quickly learned to use wampum in trade, for it opened doors with tribes far beyond our river valley. Through furs and wampum, we built both wealth and relationships.

** **

**Goods That Changed Daily Life**

The iron tools brought by the Swedes changed how we lived. Knives cut more sharply than stone, axes felled trees with less effort, and kettles made cooking easier. Muskets gave us new power in hunting and defense, though they also brought new dangers, for with guns came greater conflict. These goods made life easier in some ways, but they also tied us more closely to the newcomers and their ships.

** **

**The Balance of Exchange**

I knew as chief that trade was more than just barter—it was a balance of trust. If the Swedes gave fair measure, peace was kept. But if they grew greedy or demanded too much, suspicion grew among our people. The Susquehannocks and other tribes also sought these goods, and rivalries sharpened when traders chose sides. Trade brought both friendship and tension, and it was my duty to guide my people carefully through it.

** **

**The Lasting Impact**

The trade with the Swedes did not last forever, for the Dutch and later the English would seize their forts. But the exchange left its mark. Our ways of hunting, building, and fighting were forever changed by the iron, cloth, and weapons we received. The river carried not only canoes and fish but also goods that crossed the ocean. Trade bound us to the world beyond the horizon, and though it brought hardship, it also brought a new chapter in our people’s story.

 

 

**Daily Life of Settlers: Farming, Fishing, Hunting - Told by Måns Kling**

Life in New Sweden was not built on dreams alone but on the hard work of each day. Every settler, whether soldier, farmer, or craftsman, had to labor from dawn until dusk to make certain the colony endured. Farming, fishing, and hunting were not choices but necessities, for without them we would have perished in the wilderness.

** **

**Farming the Land**

The soil along the Delaware was fertile, though it needed to be cleared before it could yield crops. Settlers cut down the forest to make fields, and there they planted wheat, rye, barley, and oats. The Native peoples showed us the value of corn, beans, and squash, and these became staples of our diet. Farming was backbreaking, but it gave us bread and harvests that kept us alive when supplies from Sweden failed to come.

** **

**Fishing the Rivers**

The rivers and streams were rich with fish, and they became a steady source of food. Men cast nets for shad and sturgeon, while others used hooks for smaller fish. Salted and dried, these catches filled our stores for the winter. The river was not only a road for ships but also a lifeline that gave food in seasons when the fields gave little.

** **

**Hunting the Forests**

The forests around us held deer, bear, and wild fowl. Hunting required skill, and both musket and bow were used. At times, we traded with the Lenape for meat and pelts, but often we sent small hunting parties into the woods. The wild game gave us meat, hides for clothing, and furs for trade. Yet hunting was dangerous work, for the forests were vast, and it was easy to become lost or to encounter rival hunters.

** **

**The Rhythm of Each Day**

The settlers’ days followed the rhythm of the land and season. In spring, fields were planted. In summer, men fished the rivers. In autumn, hunting filled the stores. Winter tested all our preparations, for it was a season of scarcity when we depended on what we had stored. Every task, whether tending a crop or setting a trap, carried weight, for one day’s neglect could mean hunger tomorrow.

** **

**The Strength of Labor**

Though the settlers often grumbled at the hardships, I reminded them that their labor was the true strength of New Sweden. Without their farming, fishing, and hunting, the colony would have fallen to starvation. Their work made it possible for the fort to stand, for families to grow, and for the Swedish Crown to hold its claim in this land so far from home.

 

 

**Challenges of Disease and Food Shortages - Told by Johan Printz**

When I took command of New Sweden, I knew that hardship would follow us, yet even I could not have imagined the weight of disease and hunger that would test our colony. As governor, it fell to me to ensure that our people survived, but the wilderness often proved stronger than all my efforts.

** **

**Sickness in the Colony**

Illness struck often and without warning. Men and women who seemed strong one week would be laid low the next. Fevers, stomach sickness, and strange ailments we did not fully understand swept through the fort and cabins. At times, I suspected the long voyage weakened many before they even set foot on this soil. With no physicians among us, we relied on prayers, herbs, and the mercy of God, yet too often we buried those who had come with high hopes.

** **

**The Scarcity of Food**

Food was our constant struggle. Supplies from Sweden arrived rarely, and often they were not enough. The harvests we gathered from the land were uncertain, for storms, pests, and poor soils sometimes ruined the crops. In the harshest winters, I watched families ration their stores, eating only enough to stay alive. Some men took to the forests to hunt, but wild game could not always be found.

** **

**Dependence on Trade**

To survive, we turned to trade. The Lenape and Susquehannocks brought corn, fish, and meat, and in return we gave them iron tools and cloth. Their aid often saved us from disaster. Yet trade was never certain, for alliances shifted, and rivals such as the Dutch sometimes disrupted our exchanges. Still, without these Native neighbors, our colony might not have lasted even a single decade.

** **

**The Strain on Unity**

Hunger and sickness bred unrest. Settlers grumbled against me, claiming I demanded too much while giving too little. I answered them with discipline, for I believed that without order, despair would consume us all. But I carried their pain as well, for I too felt the pangs of hunger and the fear of sickness spreading through our small community.

** **

**Endurance in Hardship**

Despite these trials, we endured. Each season tested us, yet we found ways to push forward. Disease and famine left scars, but they also proved the resilience of our people. Though our colony was small, and though many lives were lost, New Sweden survived longer than many believed it would. I count this survival as one of my greatest achievements, even if it came at so high a cost.

 

 

**Governance and Law in New Sweden - Told by Johan Printz**

When I arrived in New Sweden, I carried with me the authority of the Swedish Crown. I was not only governor but also judge, commander, and overseer of every matter in the colony. In a land so far from the king and his council, order had to flow from a single hand, and that hand was mine.

** **

**Establishing Law and Order**

The laws of Sweden were to guide us even in this distant place. I required obedience to the Lutheran faith, respect for authority, and the keeping of peace among settlers. Theft, drunkenness, and disobedience were punished swiftly, for I believed that small offenses, if ignored, would lead to greater disorder. My justice was firm, but I held that it was necessary for survival.

** **

**The Role of the Governor’s Council**

I established a council of trusted men to advise me in certain matters, though the final decision was always mine. This council helped to resolve disputes among settlers, especially when land, trade, or family conflicts arose. Yet many saw me as heavy-handed, for I did not tolerate long debates when decisions needed to be made quickly.

** **

**Law Among Settlers and Soldiers**

The soldiers in the forts lived by strict military discipline. Orders were to be obeyed without question. Among the farmers and settlers, I allowed more freedom, but even they knew that rebellion or refusal to follow rules would not be tolerated. Each person had a place in the colony’s order, and all were bound to uphold it.

** **

**Relations with Native Peoples**

In dealing with the Lenape and Susquehannocks, I also applied governance, though through negotiation rather than punishment. Treaties and trade agreements had the weight of law, and I ensured that my people respected them. Still, I never allowed outsiders to dictate the rule of our colony. New Sweden was Swedish land, and Swedish law was supreme within its boundaries.

** **

**The Burden of Leadership**

Some settlers called me harsh, and others feared my temper, yet I believed that without strong governance, our colony would fall to ruin. Law was the backbone of our survival, giving structure to our daily life and unity in times of hardship. Though distant from the king’s court, I held fast to the principle that justice and authority must never be abandoned, no matter how far from home we lived.

 

 

**My Name is Johan Risingh: Governor of New Sweden**

I was born in 1617 in Sweden, a land that was rising to power in Europe under the rule of our great kings. I received an education that prepared me for service to the Crown, studying both law and administration. From a young age I was trained to think of duty, to serve faithfully, and to advance the interests of my country.

** **

**Service Before the Colony**

Before I ever set foot across the Atlantic, I worked within the Swedish government. My efforts earned me recognition, and I became known as a capable administrator. It was in these years that I learned the importance of diplomacy and negotiation, skills that would later guide me in the difficult position I would hold in America.

** **

**Appointment as Governor**

In 1654, I was appointed governor of New Sweden, following Johan Printz. The Crown expected me to strengthen the colony, secure alliances with Native peoples, and resist the influence of the Dutch and English. I accepted the appointment with great resolve, knowing that this was not simply a task of survival but of expansion.

** **

**Arrival in the New World**

When I arrived in New Sweden, I saw a colony small in number yet rich in potential. The settlers were Swedish and Finnish, hardened by labor and hopeful for a future. I set out at once to improve their situation, to renew trade, and to expand our presence along the Delaware River. It was my duty to strengthen Sweden’s claim before our rivals could overwhelm us.

** **

**Seizing Fort Casimir**

One of my boldest acts was to take Fort Casimir from the Dutch in 1654. The fort lay near present-day New Castle, Delaware, and its control meant dominance over a key stretch of the river. By capturing it, I struck directly at Dutch pride and power. For a brief moment, New Sweden seemed strong and confident, standing as an equal among colonial powers.

 

**Conflict with the Dutch**

But the Dutch did not forget this insult. Peter Stuyvesant, their governor in New Netherland, prepared a strong force in response. In 1655, he sailed with many ships and soldiers, far outnumbering anything I could muster. Though I argued and negotiated, I could not resist such overwhelming strength. The Dutch retook Fort Casimir and then moved against Fort Christina, the heart of our colony.

** **

**The Fall of New Sweden**

Despite our efforts, New Sweden was forced to surrender. I was taken back to Europe, where my time as governor was remembered with both pride and regret. Pride, because I dared to act boldly on behalf of Sweden. Regret, because I could not secure the future of the colony against far greater enemies.

 

**Later Years**

After my return, I continued to serve in government. I did not again see the shores of the Delaware River, but the memory of New Sweden remained with me until my death in 1672. I often thought of the settlers, the forts, and the Native people with whom we traded and bargained. It was a brief moment in history, but one that shaped my life.

** **

**Legacy**

I am remembered as the last governor of New Sweden, the man who tried to expand our claim but witnessed its fall. Though the Dutch took the colony, the Swedish and Finnish people remained, their log cabins, customs, and faith enduring in the Delaware Valley for generations. I was Johan Risingh, governor of New Sweden, and my life was tied to both the rise and the end of our great experiment in America.

 

 

**Role of Women in the Colony - Told by Johan Risingh**

When I came to govern New Sweden, I saw that women held a central place in the life of the colony. Though men often filled the roles of soldiers, farmers, and traders, it was women who gave stability to the settlement. They managed the homes, prepared food, and ensured that families endured through the harshest seasons. Without them, the colony would have been only a fort and not a community.

** **

**Labor and Survival**

Women worked alongside men in the fields, tending crops and caring for livestock. They gathered food from the forests, preserved what was harvested, and kept the households supplied through long winters. Spinning, weaving, and sewing were constant tasks, for clothing wore quickly in this rough land. Their labor was unending, and though less often spoken of, it was equal in importance to the work of soldiers and governors.

** **

**Mothers and Teachers**

The children of New Sweden were shaped by their mothers. Women taught them prayers, the ways of the household, and the traditions of our homeland. In a place far from Sweden, it was the women who carried the memory of our culture and faith, passing it to the next generation. By their teaching, the colony remained Swedish in spirit even as it adapted to a new world.

** **

**Strength in Hardship**

When sickness or hunger struck, women often bore the heaviest burden. They nursed the sick, rationed food, and comforted families who had lost loved ones. Their strength in such times gave courage to others. Many widows, left alone in this wilderness, still found ways to keep their families alive, proving that resilience was not only a soldier’s virtue but also a mother’s.

** **

**A Lasting Influence**

The role of women in New Sweden was not marked by titles or offices, but by their constant presence and endurance. They were the keepers of homes, the guardians of children, and the silent partners in every success of the colony. When I reflect on my time as governor, I see clearly that it was not forts or treaties alone that sustained us, but the daily labor and quiet strength of women who refused to let the colony fail.

 

 

**Arrival of More Settlers and Ships from Sweden - Told by Johan Risingh**

When I assumed leadership of New Sweden, the colony was small and fragile. Our numbers were too few to stand securely against the Dutch and English who pressed upon us. Thus, the news that ships from Sweden were on their way filled our people with great hope. Each sail that appeared on the horizon carried not only goods and tools but also new lives eager to join our settlement.

** **

**The Journey Across the Ocean**

The voyage from Sweden to the Delaware River was long and perilous. Months at sea brought sickness, storms, and hunger. Yet those who survived the crossing stepped onto our shores with determination. They brought with them fresh strength for the colony, families ready to build homes, and skilled men who could farm, craft, or defend our forts.

** **

**Supplies and Provisions**

The ships did not carry settlers alone. They also brought the supplies that our survival depended upon. Tools, nails, weapons, cloth, and even books found their way into our hands. Each barrel of flour and each chest of powder was precious. When the holds were opened, our settlers gathered eagerly, for every item meant relief from scarcity.

** **

**The Expansion of the Colony**

With the arrival of more settlers, our small outpost began to feel like a true community. Families spread outward from Fort Christina, building cabins, planting fields, and establishing new farms. Our population, though still small compared to our rivals, gave us new confidence. It allowed us to strengthen our trade, expand our defenses, and dream that New Sweden might endure for generations.

** **

**The Spirit of Renewal**

Every ship that came from Sweden reminded us that we were not forgotten by the Crown. Though months and years might pass between arrivals, the sight of new settlers and supplies renewed our spirit. The colony lived on the edge of uncertainty, but with each fresh arrival, the dream of New Sweden felt alive once more.

 

 

**Risingh’s Conflict with Dutch Governor Peter Stuyvesant - Told by Johan Risingh**

From the moment I arrived in New Sweden, the Dutch presence in New Netherland loomed over us. Their colony was larger, richer, and far better supplied. Peter Stuyvesant, their governor, was a determined and forceful man, one who saw no place for Swedish banners along the Delaware River. Our claims of land and trade were a thorn in his side, and I knew that sooner or later our paths would clash.

** **

**The Seizure of Fort Casimir**

In 1654, I made a bold decision. The Dutch had built Fort Casimir too close to our own stronghold, a clear attempt to dominate the river. I gathered men and demanded its surrender. The Dutch garrison, small and unprepared, gave way without a fight. This victory filled our people with pride, for it seemed New Sweden had taken a stand against the power of New Netherland. Yet I knew such an act would not be forgotten by Stuyvesant.

** **

**The Dutch Response**

Stuyvesant was not a man to accept insult. He prepared a fleet of ships and a strong force of soldiers. In 1655, he sailed against us, determined to bring New Sweden to its knees. His power far outmatched ours. When his forces approached, I saw that resistance would only bring bloodshed and destruction to our people.

** **

**The Surrender of New Sweden**

Faced with overwhelming numbers, I tried to negotiate, but Stuyvesant demanded nothing less than submission. Fort Casimir fell quickly, and then his forces turned to Fort Christina. I held out as long as I could, but at last I was forced to surrender the colony. It was a bitter moment, for the work of so many years and the hopes of so many settlers were swept away in a single campaign.

** **

**The Legacy of the Conflict**

My conflict with Stuyvesant marked the end of New Sweden as an independent colony. Yet even in defeat, the Swedish and Finnish settlers remained, their cabins and customs taking root in the land. Though Stuyvesant claimed victory, he could not erase the presence of our people. I look back on that conflict with regret, but also with pride that we dared to challenge a greater power, if only for a time.

 

 

**Seizing Fort Casimir from the Dutch - Told by Johan Risingh**

When I arrived in New Sweden as governor, I quickly saw the danger posed by the Dutch fort at Casimir. Built near the mouth of the Delaware River, it was a constant reminder of their claim to the land we also called our own. Its presence not only blocked our trade but also threatened the very survival of our colony. I knew that to secure New Sweden, we could not allow the Dutch to hold such a position.

** **

**The Decision to Act**

After much thought and counsel, I resolved to move against the fort. The Dutch garrison there was small, and their supplies were weak. I believed that a show of strength would force them to yield without bloodshed. Though bold, this action would prove to our settlers and to our rivals that Sweden was not afraid to defend its claim in the New World.

** **

**The Confrontation at the Fort**

I led my men to Fort Casimir and demanded its surrender. The Dutch soldiers within, taken by surprise and lacking reinforcements, quickly realized they could not resist. Rather than risk their lives, they yielded the fort without firing a shot. The Swedish flag was raised over its walls, and the fort became ours. For a moment, New Sweden stood taller than ever before.

** **

**The Reaction of the People**

The settlers rejoiced at the victory. They felt secure knowing that the Dutch stronghold was no longer a threat. To them, it was proof that we could hold our place among the great powers of the New World. I too felt pride, for it seemed that Sweden’s star was rising in America. Yet even as we celebrated, I knew this act would not go unanswered.

 

**The Consequences to Come**

Though we had gained Fort Casimir, the Dutch considered my actions a grave insult. Peter Stuyvesant, their governor, would not let such a challenge pass. In striking boldly, I secured a short-lived triumph but also set in motion the chain of events that would bring the full power of New Netherland against us. Seizing Fort Casimir was our greatest moment of strength, but it also marked the beginning of the end for New Sweden.

 

 

**Cultural Blending Between Swedes, Finns, Dutch, and Natives - Told by Mattahorn**

When the Swedes came to our river, they were not the first strangers we had seen. The Dutch had already traded with us, and the English were never far away. But when the Swedes and Finns built their fort, it brought a new kind of meeting. For the first time, our daily lives began to mix more closely with those of Europeans who sought to stay, not just trade and leave.

** **

**Learning From One Another**

The Swedes and Finns brought with them tools, ways of farming, and building methods. We watched them cut logs and raise cabins, a skill the Finns had long practiced in their forests. Our people showed them how to plant corn, fish the rivers, and travel the land by our trails. In this exchange, both sides gained. Their iron and cloth became part of our lives, and our crops and hunting grounds became part of theirs.

** **

**Shared Households and Families**

In time, families formed that carried both our blood and theirs. Children were raised who spoke both our tongue and theirs, who knew the prayers of the settlers and the stories of our elders. These unions tied our communities together in ways that no treaty alone could achieve. They showed that survival in this new land was not only about walls and forts but also about kinship.

** **

**Blending of Customs**

As we traded and lived alongside one another, customs began to blend. Some of our people wore cloth from Europe while still keeping our beads and feathers. Some settlers ate our corn and squash as often as they ate bread from their wheat. Our gatherings sometimes echoed with their hymns, while their festivals saw the sharing of our foods and dances. It was never a full merging, but pieces of each way of life passed between us.

** **

**The Strains of Difference**

Not all was harmony. The Dutch resented the Swedes, and each sought our loyalty. Rivalries pulled at us, and sometimes the settlers’ hunger for more land tested our patience. Even so, the years of contact left marks that could not be undone. Our ways touched theirs, and theirs touched ours, shaping a new life along the river.

** **

**A Legacy of Blending**

Though the Dutch would later claim the forts, the blending of cultures endured. The cabins of the Finns, the trade of the Dutch, the prayers of the Swedes, and the traditions of the Lenape all left their mark on the land. This mixture, born of need and survival, became the character of the valley. It was proof that many people could leave their imprint on one river, shaping a story greater than any one nation alone.

 

 

**Clothing, Tools, and Crafts of the Colony - Told by Måns Kling**

In New Sweden, clothing was both a mark of our homeland and an answer to the wilderness around us. Settlers wore garments much like those they had known in Sweden and Finland—wool coats, linen shirts, and sturdy trousers. Women dressed in long skirts and aprons, with shawls to guard against the chill. Yet in time, our clothing took on the mark of the New World. Deerskins, traded from the Lenape, became jackets and leggings. Moccasins replaced worn-out boots. What we wore was not only a reflection of custom but of necessity.

** **

**The Tools That Shaped Survival**

Tools were the lifeblood of our work. Axes and saws felled the trees that built our cabins and forts. Hammers, nails, and augers turned raw logs into homes. Knives and kettles, brought from Sweden, served us daily, though they wore quickly and had to be mended or replaced. Muskets were always at hand, not only for defense but for hunting, while fishing lines and nets gave food from the river. Each tool was precious, for a broken blade or rusted musket meant hardship in a place where supplies came rarely.

** **

**The Crafts of Necessity**

Every settler was forced to become a craftsman of sorts. We made what we could not import. Woodworkers shaped handles and bowls, blacksmiths forged nails and hinges, and women spun yarn and wove cloth to clothe their families. Children learned these skills young, for every hand was needed. In the evenings, the sound of spinning wheels and hammers on iron was as common as the songs of birds in the forests.

 

**The Blending of Traditions**

The crafts of our people also met the traditions of the Lenape. They taught us how to shape canoes from hollowed logs, how to weave mats from reeds, and how to use animal sinew for strong bindings. In return, our iron tools and woven cloth found their way into their villages. This exchange of knowledge strengthened both sides and gave our colony new ways to survive.

** **

**A Legacy of Workmanship**

The clothing, tools, and crafts of New Sweden were not luxuries but the marks of survival. Each stitch in a garment, each strike of a hammer, each shaped piece of wood carried the weight of life in a distant land. They reflected who we were and how we endured. Without them, our colony would have been nothing more than a dream swallowed by the wilderness.

 

 

**Education and Language in New Sweden - Told by Johan Printz**

Even in a wilderness far from home, I believed that learning must not be forgotten. A colony without knowledge would wither as quickly as one without food. Education was more than letters and numbers—it was the passing down of faith, law, and the Swedish way of life. For this reason, I sought to see that our children were taught, even when resources were scarce.

** **

**The Role of the Church**

Much of our education came through the Church. Pastors taught children their prayers, the catechism, and the reading of Scripture. Faith was the foundation of all learning, for it bound us together as a people and gave order to our lives. A child who knew how to read the Bible was not only wiser but also more obedient to God and to the Crown.

** **

**The Language of the Colony**

Swedish was our tongue, and I insisted it remain the language of our colony. In our prayers, our councils, and our daily speech, the settlers heard the familiar words of their homeland. Finnish settlers also spoke their language, and among themselves they often kept it. The Lenape spoke their own tongue, and in trade we learned enough words to bargain fairly. Yet within the walls of our forts, Swedish was the language of command and of law.

** **

**The Challenges of Teaching**

We had no great schools or halls of learning. Lessons were often given in homes, in the church, or wherever a pastor or parent had time. Books were few, and paper scarce. Most children learned to read from the Psalter or catechism, while others gained knowledge from watching their parents at work. It was not the schooling of noble families, but it gave the young the tools they needed to serve the colony.

** **

**The Lasting Influence**

Though our colony was small and short-lived, the education and language we carried gave it strength. Swedish words lingered long after Dutch and English rule took hold, and the children raised in New Sweden carried both faith and knowledge into the future. Education and language bound us to our homeland and gave us identity, even in a land far across the sea.

 

 

**Legacy of New Sweden in Delaware, New Jersey, & Pennsylvania - Told by Printz**

Though New Sweden lasted but a few short years, its memory and influence did not vanish with its surrender to the Dutch. I often reflect on how our efforts, though small in the eyes of empires, left roots that endured in the Delaware Valley. Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all bear the quiet mark of our presence.

** **

**The Log Cabin Tradition**

Perhaps the most lasting contribution of our settlers, especially the Finns, was the log cabin. Built first as a necessity in the forests of the New World, it became a symbol of frontier life. Long after the Swedes and Finns were absorbed into Dutch and later English rule, the log cabin remained, spreading westward as settlers moved inland. It was a gift from our colony to the shaping of America itself.

** **

**Faith and Community**

Our Lutheran faith also endured. Churches founded in New Sweden continued their work, and pastors carried on their teaching even after Dutch and English governors claimed authority. These churches became gathering places not only for Swedes and Finns but later for other settlers who valued faith and community. The legacy of the Lutheran church in America began with our small colony on the Delaware.

** **

**Blending of Peoples**

Swedes, Finns, Dutch, English, and Lenape lived side by side in the river valleys. While rivalries and disputes often flared, so too did marriages, friendships, and shared labor. Over time, this blending created a community unlike any one nation alone could form. The people of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania carried in their blood and customs the traces of this early mingling.

** **

**A Spirit of Endurance**

The legacy of New Sweden was not empire or conquest, for we were too small to achieve such things. Our legacy was endurance. We proved that even a modest colony could take root, adapt, and influence the future. In the fields, churches, and homes of the Delaware Valley, the spirit of New Sweden remained, shaping the lives of those who followed.

** **

**A Memory Worth Keeping**

Though history often speaks more of the Dutch and English, the memory of New Sweden deserves its place. It was born of courage, built with labor, and kept alive by the resilience of settlers who refused to surrender to hardship. Its story belongs not only to Sweden but also to Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, where its traces can still be found in the land and in the people.
