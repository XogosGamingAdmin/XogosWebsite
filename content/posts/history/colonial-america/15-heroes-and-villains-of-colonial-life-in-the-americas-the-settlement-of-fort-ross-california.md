**My Name is Ivan Kuskov: Founder of Fort Ross**

I was born in 1765 in the northern reaches of Russia, far from the lands where I would one day build a settlement. My youth was shaped by hard work and the discipline of service. When I was a young man, I entered into the service of the Russian-American Company, an organization charged with extending our empire’s influence and wealth across the Pacific. My loyalty and abilities earned me trust, and I was eventually chosen for a great responsibility: to establish a colony in California.

** **

**Journey Across the Pacific**

The Russian-American Company needed fertile lands to support our colonies in Alaska. The harsh northern climate made farming nearly impossible, and our settlements there relied heavily on trade and outside supply. I was selected to lead expeditions south to find a place where we might grow food, raise animals, and build a foothold for Russia. With sailors, Aleut hunters, and skilled craftsmen, I traveled across the waters and set my eyes on the coast of California, a land of green hills, oak groves, and rocky shores.

** **

**Founding Fort Ross**

In 1812, I led the establishment of Fort Ross on a bluff above the Pacific Ocean. It was the southernmost Russian settlement in North America. We built sturdy walls of redwood, a chapel, barracks, houses, and storehouses. Cannon were mounted to guard against threats, though our greatest challenges came not from war but from the difficulties of distance, supply, and survival. We hunted sea otters, traded with ships, and farmed the surrounding land, though not always with the success we had hoped.

** **

**Relations with Native Peoples**

The Kashaya Pomo people lived in the area long before we arrived. Some welcomed us, offering labor and trade, while others resisted our presence. We brought both cooperation and disruption. I cannot deny that our arrival changed their lives forever. Many Aleut hunters from Alaska also lived at Fort Ross, working in dangerous hunts for furs along the coast. The fort became a place of many cultures meeting—Russian, Aleut, Kashaya, and even Spanish and Mexican visitors.

 

**Challenges and Decline**

Despite our efforts, Fort Ross struggled to provide the agricultural abundance we needed. Crops failed at times, and the expense of maintaining the colony weighed heavily on the Russian-American Company. I served faithfully, overseeing the fort and its people, but I knew that our dream of a strong Russian colony in California was fragile. Eventually, our leaders decided the fort was no longer worth the burden.

** **

**Legacy and Reflection**

I returned to Russia before my death in 1823, leaving behind the colony I had founded. Years later, in 1841, Russia sold Fort Ross to John Sutter, ending our presence in California. Yet the memory of those years remains. I was not a great nobleman or a famous general, but I was entrusted with building a community at the edge of the world. My life’s work was Fort Ross, a place where cultures met and history was made. It stands today as a reminder of Russia’s reach across the Pacific and of my role in shaping the story of California.

 

 

**Russian Expansion into Alaska and the Pacific – Told by Ivan Kuskov**

Our story began when Russian explorers and traders looked eastward across the vastness of Siberia. By the seventeenth century, men known as promyshlenniki pushed through the frozen wilderness, seeking furs. The lure of sable, fox, and other valuable pelts drew them all the way to the edge of the Pacific. It was there, at the easternmost reaches of our empire, that we gazed across the waters and wondered what lay beyond. Soon, daring sailors crossed to Alaska, where rich hunting grounds awaited.

** **

**The Birth of Russian America**

By the mid-eighteenth century, explorers like Vitus Bering charted the northern seas, proving that Alaska was within reach of our ships. In the decades that followed, Russian settlements were planted on the Aleutian Islands. These places were cold and harsh, yet the abundance of sea otters promised wealth. Traders and hunters followed, often forcing the Aleut people into dangerous hunts. This was the beginning of Russian America, a land far from Moscow yet bound by the same hunger for profit and power.

** **

**The Role of the Russian-American Company**

As trade grew, the Russian crown recognized the need for order and profit. In 1799, the Russian-American Company was created, a powerful monopoly granted control over trade, settlement, and exploration. Its task was to harvest the riches of the Pacific while spreading the reach of our empire. It was through this company that I, Ivan Kuskov, rose to prominence. I served faithfully, managing posts, leading expeditions, and preparing for a new vision: to push farther south.

 

**Why We Looked to California**

Life in Alaska was difficult. The land was poor for farming, the winters long, and supplies scarce. Our people needed food to survive, yet we could not grow enough in the frozen north. California, with its fertile valleys and mild climate, appeared as a promised land. If we could build a settlement there, we could provide grain, cattle, and vegetables to support our colonies. This was not only about feeding our people but also about showing the world that Russia could plant its flag far down the Pacific coast.

** **

**The First Steps Toward Expansion**

I was chosen to lead expeditions to California to test its lands and resources. We sailed southward from Alaska, charting the coastlines, meeting native peoples, and studying the fields and forests. What I saw convinced me that we must act. By 1812, I led the establishment of Fort Ross, a bold step in Russia’s expansion into the Pacific. Though we faced many hardships, our fort was proof of Russia’s determination to stretch its power beyond the icy north, into the fertile lands of California.

 

 

**The Russian-American Company’s Goals and Motives – Told by Ivan Kuskov**

In 1799, the Russian crown granted a powerful charter to a new organization: the Russian-American Company. This company was not simply a group of merchants; it was given authority by the emperor himself to govern lands, trade in furs, and expand Russia’s influence across the Pacific. It was both a commercial enterprise and a tool of empire, tasked with turning distant territories into part of Russia’s growing domain.

** **

**The Pursuit of Wealth**

The company’s first and foremost goal was profit. Sea otter pelts were more valuable than gold in the markets of China, where their thick, soft fur was prized by nobles. Every expedition, every hunting voyage, was designed to bring back more pelts. Ships carried furs from Alaska to Canton, exchanging them for tea, silks, and goods that could not be found in Russia. The hunger for wealth drove men to risk storms, hunger, and even death on the cold northern seas.

** **

**Securing Territory for the Empire**

Yet profit was not enough. The Russian-American Company was also charged with spreading Russia’s power. Each post we built, each fort we raised, was a mark of our claim to new lands. This was a race with other nations, for the British and the Spanish also sought dominance along the Pacific coast. By planting settlements, Russia could strengthen its voice in the great contest of empires.

** **

**The Need for Food and Supplies**

The company soon faced a challenge greater than foreign rivals: survival. Alaska’s soil yielded little, and winters crushed any attempt at farming. Our hunters and settlers relied on food brought from far away, and shortages threatened the future of Russian America. This is why California became so important. Its fertile lands could provide wheat, vegetables, and cattle to feed our northern colonies. Without a steady supply of food, no empire could last.

** **

**A Balance of Trade and Survival**

The Russian-American Company’s motives were a mixture of wealth, power, and necessity. Profit from furs filled the coffers, claims of new lands strengthened Russia’s standing, and the search for fertile soil promised survival for our people. My role within this company was to act on these goals, to find a way for Russia not only to hunt and trade but also to live and grow in the New World. This mission would one day lead me to the coast of California, where I founded Fort Ross.

 

 

**The Selection of the California Coast for Agriculture and Trade – Told by Kuskov**

The Russian-American Company looked to me and others to solve a growing problem. Our colonies in Alaska suffered greatly from hunger and scarcity. We could not grow enough food in the frozen ground, and shipments from Russia were too distant and uncertain. The company ordered me to sail south, to find a place where our people could cultivate the soil, raise livestock, and secure the supplies that were essential to survival.

** **

**First Impressions of California**

When I first set foot on the California coast, I was struck by its beauty and abundance. The rolling hills were covered with grasses, oak groves stood tall, and streams flowed down to the ocean. Deer roamed the forests, and salmon filled the rivers. The climate was mild, unlike the harsh winters of Alaska, and the land seemed to promise a steady harvest. It was clear to me that this was a place where Russian settlers could farm and trade.

** **

**Strategic Importance**

Beyond food, the coast of California offered something else: position. It lay between our struggling Alaskan posts and the bustling markets of Spanish Mexico. From here we could supply our northern colonies and also expand trade with ships that passed along the Pacific routes. We were aware of the Spanish missions to the south, and I knew that our presence would not go unnoticed, but the Russians could not ignore the potential of this land.

** **

**The Decision to Build a Settlement**

After surveying the coast, I chose a bluff north of Bodega Bay for our settlement. The location was strong, with redwood forests nearby for building and a commanding view of the sea. It lay close enough to fertile valleys for farming and grazing, yet far enough from Spanish settlements to give us some measure of independence. Here, I believed, we could build a colony that would feed Alaska and strengthen Russia’s hold on the Pacific.

** **

**The Promise of Agriculture and Trade**

The vision was clear: fields of wheat and vegetables, herds of cattle and sheep, and ships carrying goods to support Russian America. We dreamed of trading not only with our own colonies but also with foreign merchants, perhaps even with the Spanish themselves. California was to be the answer to our needs, the land that would sustain Russia’s presence across the ocean. With this vision, the company approved the establishment of Fort Ross, the outpost that became my life’s greatest work.

 

 

**My Name is Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo: Governor and Military Commander of California**

I was born in 1807 in Monterey, when California was still a distant province of Spain. My family was deeply tied to military service, and from a young age I was raised with a sense of duty and leadership. As I grew, the world around me shifted. By the time I was a teenager, Mexico had won its independence from Spain, and I became a citizen of a new nation. My future would be bound to defending and governing this far northern frontier.

** **

**Rise to Leadership**

Through hard work and discipline, I rose quickly in the Mexican military. I was appointed comandante of the northern frontier, entrusted with protecting settlers and maintaining order in lands that stretched from the Bay Area to the Russian settlements at Fort Ross. With this role came great responsibility, for California was a place where many cultures met: Native peoples, Mexican rancheros, foreign traders, and the Russians who had built their fort on the coast.

** **

**Relations with the Russians**

I watched the Russians with careful eyes. They built Fort Ross in 1812, before my time as comandante, but their presence still raised questions of sovereignty and power. We Mexicans considered California our land, yet the Russians had planted their flag and built their walls within our borders. I sought to maintain peace and diplomacy, recognizing that outright war would weaken both sides. At times we traded with them, at times we argued over boundaries, but I never forgot that my duty was to protect Mexico’s claim.

** **

**Challenges of the Frontier**

The northern frontier was not an easy post. Resources were limited, and our hold on California was fragile. Native uprisings, foreign ships, and the growing influence of Americans all demanded my attention. I worked to build alliances with Native groups, though not always with success, and I granted land to settlers in hopes of strengthening Mexico’s presence. My own family became landowners, and I dreamed of a California that could prosper under Mexican leadership.

** **

**The Departure of the Russians**

By the 1830s, it became clear that the Russians could not sustain Fort Ross. Their crops failed, their sea otters were nearly gone, and the Russian-American Company lost interest in supporting such a distant colony. In 1841 they abandoned the fort and sold it to John Sutter. I felt relief that Mexico’s claims no longer faced that foreign threat, though I also knew that new challenges would soon rise from the east, as Americans poured into California.

** **

**Later Years and Legacy**

I lived long enough to see California change hands once again, this time becoming part of the United States after the war of 1846–1848. I served the new government, though my loyalty remained with the land of my birth more than with distant rulers. My life was shaped by change: from Spanish rule, to Mexican independence, to American conquest. Through it all, I tried to serve as a leader, a soldier, and a statesman. My name remains tied to California’s history, for I stood at the crossroads where nations met and where Fort Ross marked one of the strangest chapters in our frontier.

 

 

**Relations with the Spanish Missions and Initial Reactions – Told by Mariano Vallejo**

When I was a young man, the Spanish missions still stood as the pillars of authority in California. They were not only places of worship but also centers of farming, ranching, and political control. The padres guided the lives of thousands of Native people, who were brought into the mission system to labor in the fields and workshops. The missions were also the eyes and ears of the Spanish crown, ensuring that foreign powers could not move easily into our territory.

** **

**The Arrival of the Russians**

In 1812, before my time as comandante, the Russians established Fort Ross north of the missions. Their presence was unexpected and alarming. Spain considered California sacred ground, not to be shared with any other power. The padres feared that the Russians, who had already built posts in Alaska, now threatened to creep farther south. Though the fort was distant from the main centers of settlement, its very existence challenged Spain’s authority.

** **

**First Reactions of Suspicion**

The Spanish reaction was cautious but suspicious. Soldiers and missionaries alike believed the Russians were not to be trusted. Reports were sent south to Monterey and Mexico City, warning that Russia had planted itself on our frontier. Expeditions were sometimes dispatched to watch their movements. Yet Spain lacked the manpower to remove them outright, for our forces were thinly stretched across a vast land. Instead, we relied on watchfulness, diplomacy, and the hope that the Russians would not grow stronger.

** **

**The Role of the Missions in Response**

The missions closest to Fort Ross, such as San Rafael and San Francisco Solano, became watchpoints against Russian influence. Padres tried to strengthen their hold over nearby Native peoples, fearing that the Russians might lure them away with goods or promises. At the same time, the missions occasionally traded indirectly with the Russians, for practical needs often outweighed politics. This uneasy balance of suspicion and necessity defined the early years of contact.

** **

**My Perspective as a Leader**

When I came into authority under Mexican rule, I inherited this legacy of strained relations. By then, Spain had fallen and Mexico had risen, but the same question remained: what place did the Russians have in California? My duty was to guard our frontier and uphold sovereignty. I saw the Russians as intruders, but I also recognized that outright hostility would be costly. Thus, our initial reactions—suspicion, caution, and careful diplomacy—set the pattern for the decades that followed.

 

 

**The Establishment of Fort Ross in 1812 – Told by Ivan Kuskov**

In 1812 I led the expedition that would plant Russia’s southernmost colony in North America. We set sail from Alaska with sailors, Aleut hunters, craftsmen, and supplies entrusted to us by the Russian-American Company. Our voyage was long, but I carried with me a vision: to find fertile soil and build a settlement that could feed our northern outposts. When we reached the coast of California, I knew that this land, with its mild air and rolling hills, held promise.

** **

**Choosing the Location**

After exploring the coast, I selected a bluff north of Bodega Bay. It stood high above the sea, offering a commanding view of the ocean, while nearby streams, forests, and open fields provided the resources we needed. The great redwoods gave us timber for strong walls and buildings, while the surrounding valleys could be planted with crops. The site was close enough for trade but far from the nearest Spanish missions, which gave us some distance from their watchful eyes.

**Building the Fort**

We began at once, cutting the giant redwoods and shaping them into timbers. With careful labor, we raised high palisade walls, over twenty feet tall, surrounding a stronghold that would become Fort Ross. Inside we built houses for the settlers, barracks for soldiers, a chapel for prayer, and storehouses for supplies. At the corners of the fort we placed blockhouses and mounted cannons, ready to defend against threats by land or sea. Within a short time, a small Russian community stood where none had been before.

** **

**Life in the Settlement**

Life at Fort Ross was both difficult and full of purpose. Russians, Aleuts, and Native workers lived and labored together, each contributing to the survival of the colony. We hunted sea otters along the coast, raised livestock, and began planting crops. The fort was alive with activity: blacksmiths at their forges, carpenters shaping wood, hunters preparing for voyages, and families settling into their new homes. It was not easy, but it was the foundation of Russia’s future in California.

** **

**The Meaning of Our Work**

The establishment of Fort Ross marked more than the raising of walls; it was the fulfillment of Russia’s dream to expand into fertile lands beyond Alaska. Though small and far from home, the settlement carried the weight of empire on its shoulders. For me, it was the crowning achievement of my service to the Russian-American Company, a symbol of determination and hope for the survival of our people in the Pacific.

 

 

**The Construction of the Fort, Buildings, and Cannon Defenses – Told by Kuskov**

When we arrived at the chosen site, our first task was to cut the mighty redwoods that grew nearby. These towering trees gave us the timbers we needed to build walls both strong and tall. We shaped each log carefully and set them upright in the ground to form palisades more than twenty feet high. The walls enclosed our new home and marked a clear boundary between us and the vast wilderness beyond. Every blow of the axe and strike of the hammer echoed with the knowledge that we were securing a foothold for Russia on foreign soil.

** **

**Building the Heart of the Settlement**

Inside the walls, we set about raising the structures that would sustain life. We built houses for the officers, barracks for soldiers, and cottages for workers. A chapel stood at the center, for we carried our faith with us even into this distant land. Workshops, kitchens, and storerooms were built with care so that daily needs could be met. Each building was simple yet strong, built to endure the coastal winds and rains. Together they formed the heart of a living community, where men, women, and children could find shelter and purpose.

** **

**Preparing for Defense**

Though we hoped for peace, we could not ignore the dangers of our position. Other nations had interest in California, and we knew that the Spanish missions to the south watched our movements closely. To guard against threats, we built blockhouses at the corners of the fort. These towers allowed us to see far across the land and sea, and from them we could defend the fort if attacked. Our cannons, heavy and iron, were mounted within these blockhouses and along the walls. Their presence gave us security, a reminder to any who approached that we were prepared to defend what we had built.

** **

**The Labor of Many Hands**

The construction of the fort was not the work of Russians alone. Aleut hunters, Native people from the surrounding lands, and craftsmen from many places contributed their skills and strength. Each log raised and each stone set was the result of many hands working together. Though we came from different homelands and spoke different tongues, necessity bound us in a common task. Without their efforts, Fort Ross could never have stood.

** **

**The Meaning of the Defenses**

When the walls were complete and the cannons set, I felt both pride and relief. Fort Ross was more than wood and stone; it was a symbol of Russia’s determination to survive and prosper on the Pacific coast. The defenses gave us confidence, and the buildings gave us stability. From that day forward, our colony stood as both a home and a fortress, ready to face the challenges of an uncertain future.

 

 

**My Name is Chief Kashaya Pomo: Leader of My People**

I was born among the Kashaya Pomo, whose homeland stretches along the coast of what you now call northern California. Our people lived in villages surrounded by oak groves, redwoods, and the endless sea. We fished the rivers, gathered shellfish, and hunted deer in the forests. Our lives were balanced by the rhythms of the seasons, the guidance of our elders, and the songs and dances that honored the spirits of the land. For countless generations, we lived without walls or cannons, without ships crossing the horizon.

** **

**First Sight of the Russians**

In 1812, we saw something new upon our shores. Strangers from across the ocean arrived, led by a man named Ivan Kuskov. They came with ships of wood and sails like wings. At first, we did not know if they brought war or peace. They built a stronghold they called Fort Ross. Its tall redwood walls rose above the bluff, unlike anything we had seen. Our people watched carefully, uncertain of what this meant for our future.

** **

**Living Beside the Fort**

Some of our people worked with the Russians. They offered tools, cloth, and metal goods in exchange for labor. We helped them fish, gather food, and tend animals. Yet their ways were not ours. They cut forests quickly, hunted sea otters until they were scarce, and built homes that kept out the wind but also kept out the sky. They brought Aleut hunters from the north, and soon our homeland became a place of many tongues and customs. Not all encounters were peaceful. Some among us resisted, unwilling to see our lives changed.

** **

**Struggles and Sorrows**

With the Russians came sickness that we had never known before. Diseases spread through our villages, taking many lives. Our hunting grounds and fishing waters grew strained as more mouths sought food. Even as some of our people gained tools and goods, others mourned the loss of traditions and land. The fort cast a long shadow over our villages, a reminder that the world we had known was shifting.

** **

**Watching the Departure**

After many years, the Russians found their fort too difficult to keep. The land did not give them enough crops, and their company struggled to support such a distant outpost. When they finally left in 1841, selling the fort to John Sutter, we were left with mixed feelings. We had seen strangers arrive, stay, and then depart, leaving behind walls that still stood but no longer held the same meaning.

** **

**My People’s Legacy**

Though others came to claim this land—Mexicans, then Americans—we Kashaya Pomo remain. We are the first people of this place, bound to the hills, rivers, and ocean. The story of Fort Ross is also the story of my people: how we endured, adapted, and survived even as powerful nations used our land for their own purposes. I am proud to be Kashaya, and my life is a thread in the larger fabric of our people’s history.

 

 

**Daily Life of Russian Settlers, Aleuts, and Native Workers – Told by Chief Kashaya**

When the Russians built their fort upon our land, they did not come alone. With them were Aleut hunters from the northern islands, men skilled in hunting sea otters from their small boats. Soon, our Kashaya people also found ourselves within their world, working in fields, tending animals, or serving in their workshops. Inside those high redwood walls, three peoples—Russians, Aleuts, and Natives—lived side by side, though not always as equals.

** **

**The Rhythm of the Russians**

The Russians began their days early. Soldiers drilled with their weapons, farmers and craftsmen turned to their duties, and the ringing of hammers filled the fort. They raised livestock, planted wheat and vegetables, and spent long hours trying to make the land yield food for their distant Alaskan posts. Families lived within the fort, women cooked in the kitchens, and the small chapel called them to prayer. Their lives were filled with order and labor, always striving to hold onto this faraway outpost.

** **

**The Work of the Aleuts**

The Aleut hunters were perhaps the hardest pressed. They were taken from their northern homes and brought to California to dive into cold waters in fragile skin boats, hunting sea otters that brought great wealth to the Russians. Their work was dangerous, for the waves were fierce and the animals strong. When they were not at sea, they lived in small huts outside the fort, crafting tools, mending their boats, or resting from their hunts. Many of them longed for their distant islands, yet they had little choice but to serve.

 

**The Labor of My People**

Some of my Kashaya joined them, though our roles were different. We gathered food, cut wood, tended fields, and sometimes worked inside the fort itself. In return, we received beads, cloth, or tools, things that were useful but also drew us further into the Russians’ way of life. Not all chose to take part, for some feared losing our traditions, but others found necessity in the work. Each day our people walked the line between survival and change, between serving the strangers and keeping our identity.

** **

**The Strain of Many Worlds Together**

Though these three groups lived in one place, their lives were separate. Russians dined at their tables, Aleuts kept to their huts, and our Kashaya often returned to our villages after labor. At times there was friendship, at times conflict, but always there was difference. The fort was a place of many languages, customs, and beliefs, pressed together by need rather than unity. Daily life there showed both the strength of cooperation and the cost of living under foreign rule.

 

 

**Trade with Alaska: Sea Otter Hunting and Food Supplies – Told by Ivan Kuskov**

From the beginning, the lifeblood of Russian America was the fur trade. The soft pelts of the sea otter were among the most prized goods in the world, fetching high prices in the markets of China. It was for this reason that the Russian-American Company invested so heavily in sending hunters to the waters of Alaska and later California. Each pelt represented wealth, each hunt a gamble against the sea and the strength of the animal. Without this trade, our settlements would not have survived.

** **

**The Role of the Aleut Hunters**

The Aleuts, skilled men from the northern islands, were forced into this dangerous labor. They hunted from small skin boats called baidarkas, paddling through rough waves and icy waters to strike at the sea otters with harpoons. Their skill and endurance made the trade possible, yet it came at great cost. Many never returned from the hunts, claimed by the sea or injured in the struggle. Their work filled the warehouses of the Russian-American Company and lined the pockets of traders far away, while their own lives were bound to hardship.

** **

**Connecting California to Alaska**

Fort Ross was built not only for farming but also to extend this trade southward. The waters of California, too, held sea otters, though their numbers dwindled quickly under constant hunting. Pelts gathered along the coast were sent north to Alaska and then across the ocean to China. At the same time, California was meant to send food in the other direction. Wheat, vegetables, and cattle raised near the fort were shipped to Alaska to keep our northern colonies alive through long winters.

** **

**The Struggle for Food Supplies**

Even with fertile land, success was not always guaranteed. Crops sometimes failed, livestock suffered, and the distance between colonies made transport difficult. Ships carried food north, but storms or shortages could delay or ruin the shipments. The balance was fragile: Alaska depended on California for food, and California depended on Alaska and the wider trade for wealth. This web of exchange kept us alive, but it was always uncertain, a reminder of how far we were from the heart of Russia.

** **

**The Purpose Behind the Trade**

The fur trade and the supply of food were tied together as the foundation of our presence in the Pacific. Pelts gave us wealth, but food gave us survival. Without both, our colonies could not endure. My task at Fort Ross was to ensure that these needs were met, to manage the hunting, farming, and shipping that bound our scattered settlements together. It was not always successful, but it was the vision upon which the Russian-American Company placed its hopes for empire.

 

 

**The Kashaya Pomo’s Role in the Settlement – Told by Chief Kashaya Pomo**

Long before the Russians came, our people lived along the coast and in the valleys where the rivers meet the sea. We were the Kashaya Pomo, and this land was our home. We gathered acorns from the oaks, caught salmon in the streams, and hunted deer in the forests. Our villages were woven into the landscape, our traditions tied to the rhythm of the seasons. This was the life we knew before the strangers raised their wooden walls on the bluff.

** **

**The Arrival of the Russians**

When the Russians came in 1812, they brought new ways with them—tools of iron, animals we had never seen in such numbers, and a hunger for furs and fields. Some among us feared their presence, while others saw opportunities in the goods they carried. They built Fort Ross not far from our villages, and from the beginning, our lives were drawn into theirs.

** **

**Work and Exchange**

Many of our people worked with the Russians. We cut timber, hauled stone, gathered food, and tended fields. Some helped raise livestock, learning new tasks in exchange for beads, cloth, or metal tools. The Russians needed our knowledge of the land, and we needed some of the things they offered. Yet this exchange was not always fair. Our labor gave strength to their settlement, while our people bore the weight of change.

** **

**Shifts in Our Daily Life**

Our villages began to feel the strain of the fort’s presence. Hunting grounds grew crowded, rivers yielded fewer fish, and the gathering of acorns became harder as the Russians cleared the land for their fields. Still, we remained tied to our traditions—dances, stories, and ceremonies continued, even as the world around us shifted. Working for the fort was only part of our lives; we returned to our villages and carried on as Kashaya.

** **

**The Meaning of Our Role**

Our role in the settlement was both vital and costly. Without us, the Russians would not have endured, for they depended on our skills and knowledge of the land. Yet in helping them, we also faced loss—of freedom, of resources, and of health as foreign sickness spread among us. Still, we survived. We are the Kashaya, and even after the Russians left, our people remained, rooted in the same hills, forests, and ocean that sustained our ancestors.

 

 

**Cultural Exchange & Conflicts between Russians and Natives – By Chief Kashaya**

When the Russians settled at Fort Ross, they brought with them things our people had never seen before. Iron tools, wool clothing, glass beads, and firearms entered our world, and many among us welcomed these items. They made certain tasks easier and became symbols of trade and connection. In return, we shared food, labor, and knowledge of the land. At times, there was a spirit of curiosity, as we learned from one another and lived side by side.

** **

**Shared Knowledge and Skills**

The Russians learned to fish our waters and to gather what the land provided, often with our guidance. We watched their ways of farming and raising cattle, skills that were foreign to us but useful in their design. Some of our people even adopted pieces of their clothing, language, or tools, blending them into our lives. In this way, there was cultural exchange, a meeting of worlds that brought both benefit and change.

** **

**Rising Tensions**

Yet these exchanges did not erase the differences between us. The Russians and their Aleut hunters took much from the land and sea. Sea otters grew scarce, salmon runs weakened, and game became harder to find. Disputes rose when their needs pressed against our survival. At times, anger turned to open conflict, as our people resisted being drawn too deeply into their labor or losing too much of what had always been ours.

** **

**The Weight of Disease and Loss**

Along with trade came sicknesses our people had never known. Illness spread quickly through our villages, taking lives and leaving sorrow. These losses fueled resentment, for what good were beads or tools if families were broken by death? We came to see that the gifts of exchange carried hidden costs that cut deeply into the heart of our community.

** **

**Finding Balance Amid Struggle**

Despite conflicts, there were moments of peace and cooperation. Friendships formed between individuals, and some marriages tied our people to the Russians. We endured through adaptation, holding to our ceremonies and traditions while navigating this new world. Our history with the Russians was one of both exchange and struggle, a story of survival as we balanced what we gained against what we lost.

 

 

**Relations with Other Indigenous Groups (Miwok, Coast Miwok, etc.) – Told by Chief Kashaya Pomo**

Long before the Russians arrived, we Kashaya lived beside many other peoples. To the south and east were the Coast Miwok and Miwok groups, each with their own languages, traditions, and territories. We traded with them, sometimes competed for resources, and at times celebrated together. These relationships were part of the balance of life, shaped by kinship, marriage, and respect for boundaries.

** **

**The Fort Changes Everything**

When the Russians built their fort, this balance shifted. The newcomers drew not only upon our labor but also upon that of other tribes. Some Miwok came to Fort Ross seeking work, while others resisted the presence of foreigners on their lands. The Russians saw all of us as useful for their survival, and this drew different groups into closer contact than before. What had once been separate ways of life now became intertwined through the demands of the fort.

** **

**Trade and Shared Burdens**

Among the tribes, goods passed more frequently once the Russians offered tools, cloth, and beads. Miwok, Pomo, and others exchanged these items through their own networks, spreading foreign goods far beyond the fort’s walls. Yet along with trade came burdens. Hunting grounds grew more strained, and disagreements rose over who should work for the Russians or who should resist them. These new pressures sometimes caused quarrels between neighboring groups that had once lived in relative peace.

 

**Alliances and Tensions**

The Russians often played one group against another, offering trade or favors to secure loyalty. Some Miwok aligned themselves more closely with the fort, while others opposed it, and this sometimes placed us Kashaya in the middle. Though we sought peace, the presence of a foreign power tested old bonds and forced us to navigate shifting alliances.

** **

**Enduring Connections**

Despite the challenges, we maintained ties with our neighbors. Intermarriage continued, shared ceremonies were held, and our languages and stories flowed between villages. The Russians eventually left, but our connections to the Miwok and other peoples endured. Our history with them is older and deeper than any fort, and it reminds us that our survival came not only from our own strength but also from the relationships we built with those who shared this land.

 

 

**Tensions with Spanish and Mexican Authorities – Told by Mariano Vallejo**

When the Russians established Fort Ross in 1812, Spain still ruled California. The missions and presidios were unsettled by their presence, for it was seen as a trespass into Spanish territory. Reports of the fort’s construction spread quickly south, and Spanish authorities feared that Russia intended to push farther down the coast. Yet Spain’s resources in California were limited. With only a few soldiers scattered across a vast frontier, they could not easily challenge the Russians, so suspicion and watchfulness became their answer.

** **

**The Shift to Mexican Control**

In 1821 Mexico won its independence from Spain, and California passed into the hands of a new government. This change did not lessen the concerns about the Russians. Mexico inherited Spain’s claim to California and with it the responsibility of defending the northern frontier. However, like Spain, Mexico faced the difficulty of distance and scarcity. Soldiers were few, missions struggled, and authority was often more symbolic than real. The Russians remained, tolerated because Mexico lacked the strength to force them out.

** **

**Conflicts Over Sovereignty**

As comandante of the northern frontier, I saw firsthand the strain of this situation. The Russians flew their flag on Mexican soil, built their fort, and carried on their trade as if they were independent. Our officials demanded recognition of Mexico’s rights, but the Russians often ignored such claims. This was not open war, but it was a contest of sovereignty, with both sides seeking to maintain their ground without provoking a costly conflict.

** **

**Trade and Practical Needs**

Despite these tensions, necessity sometimes softened the standoff. The missions and settlements of Mexico needed goods that the Russians could provide, and the Russians needed food and supplies from us. Quiet exchanges took place, even as official voices spoke of foreign intrusion. This uneasy mix of rivalry and reliance defined much of our relationship. We could not accept them as rightful occupants, yet we could not wholly reject the trade they offered.

** **

**The Lingering Strain**

The Russians remained in California until 1841, and throughout those years, tension with both Spanish and Mexican authorities never disappeared. Their presence was a constant reminder of the weakness of our frontier, a foreign flag standing in defiance of our claims. Though diplomacy and caution prevented bloodshed, the memory of those years remained with me. It was proof of how fragile sovereignty can be when distant governments lack the strength to defend their borders.

 

 

**The Economic Struggles of the Russian-American Company – Told by Ivan Kuskov**

When the Russian-American Company first expanded into Alaska and then to California, hopes were high. The sea otter trade had brought great profit, and the markets of China seemed endless in their demand for pelts. At first, it appeared that we would build an empire of trade across the Pacific, feeding our northern colonies from the fertile lands of California and filling our coffers with the riches of fur.

** **

**The Decline of the Sea Otter**

Yet fortune does not last forever. By the time Fort Ross was built, the sea otters had already been hunted in great numbers. Each season, fewer were found along the coasts, and hunters had to travel farther for smaller rewards. The very foundation of our trade began to collapse, for without the pelts, the company lost its greatest source of wealth. The decline of the sea otter population struck a heavy blow from which we never truly recovered.

** **

**The Burden of Distance**

Another great challenge was distance. Our colonies were thousands of miles from Russia, and even from one another. Supplies had to be shipped across treacherous seas, often arriving late or spoiled. Transporting goods from California to Alaska and then across the Pacific was costly and uncertain. Each shipment risked storms, loss, or delay, and the company’s accounts grew strained under the weight of such expenses.

 

**Farming That Fell Short**

Part of the dream of Fort Ross was to make California our breadbasket, feeding Alaska with wheat, vegetables, and livestock. But the land, while fertile, did not always yield as we hoped. Crops failed in poor seasons, and cattle were not enough to meet the demand. The cost of maintaining the colony outpaced its ability to provide, leaving the company to question whether the effort was worth the reward.

** **

**Competition and Isolation**

We also faced rivals. The Spanish and later the Mexicans watched us with suspicion, limiting our ability to trade freely. Foreign merchants from Britain and America sailed these waters too, offering goods and prices that undercut our own. We were isolated, caught between empires, struggling to survive in a land that was not ours.

** **

**The Weight of Struggle**

As the years passed, the company could no longer ignore these realities. Profits dwindled, expenses grew, and the dream of a strong Russian colony in California began to fade. For me, the struggle was personal, for I had given my life to this work. Yet even I could see that the company’s hopes had outgrown its reach. The economic burden was too great, and eventually, the decision was made to abandon Fort Ross.

 

 

**Mexico’s Independence and its Impact on California Colonies – Told by Vallejo**

In 1821, after a long struggle, Mexico achieved independence from Spain. For those of us in California, the news reached us slowly, carried by ships and messengers from the south. We had lived so long under the authority of Spain that it was hard to imagine life under a new flag. The missions, presidios, and pueblos had been built in the name of the Spanish crown, but now we were called to serve a new nation.

** **

**The Promise of Change**

At first, independence was met with hope. Many believed that Mexico would bring greater freedom, less distance between rulers and ruled, and a chance for Californios to take leadership in their own land. The priests who had long dominated the missions would no longer answer to Spain, and the military officers in the presidios looked to Mexico City for direction instead of Madrid. We felt the possibility of a future shaped more by our own people than by distant kings.

** **

**The Weakness of the New Government**

Yet the reality was more complicated. Mexico, though free from Spain, was unstable and burdened by its own struggles. The central government was weak, and its ability to send soldiers, supplies, or money to distant California was limited. Our presidios often went unpaid, our settlements were left without support, and we were forced to fend for ourselves. Independence gave us new pride, but it also left us exposed to hardship.

** **

**The Secularization of the Missions**

One of the most significant changes was the secularization of the missions. Lands once controlled by the church were promised to settlers and Native people, though in truth much of it ended up in the hands of Californios like myself. This change weakened the mission system that had dominated California under Spain, but it also created tension, as Native communities were left without the structure that had shaped their lives for decades. Independence reshaped land, power, and identity across the province.

** **

**Impact on Relations with Foreigners**

Mexico’s independence also changed how we dealt with foreigners. No longer under Spain’s strict restrictions, trade with outside powers increased. American ships, British merchants, and yes, even the Russians at Fort Ross, became part of California’s economic life. This brought both opportunity and danger, for while trade enriched some, it also invited foreign influence into our fragile frontier.

** **

**A Land in Transition**

Mexico’s independence was both a victory and a trial for California. It gave us a chance to shape our own destiny, yet it also left us vulnerable, with little support from the distant capital. I was a young man during this transformation, and I soon found myself called to leadership, tasked with protecting our land and guiding it through uncertain times. The shadow of Spain had lifted, but the challenges of building a future under Mexico had only just begun.

 

 

**Diplomatic Negotiations between Mexico and Russia – Told by Mariano Vallejo**

When Mexico gained independence, we inherited not only vast lands but also the burdens left by Spain. One of these was the presence of the Russians at Fort Ross. Their settlement had stood since 1812, and while small, it was a constant reminder that another empire had planted its flag on land we considered our own. The question before us was clear: how could Mexico assert its sovereignty without the strength to drive them out by force?

** **

**First Steps Toward Dialogue**

Mexico’s leaders chose the path of diplomacy. Letters were exchanged, envoys were sent, and cautious words replaced open hostility. The Russians claimed their fort was for trade and survival, not conquest, and they insisted their presence did not threaten Mexico’s control of California. Yet for us, their very existence was a challenge, and so negotiations became a delicate balance between asserting our rights and avoiding conflict that we could not afford.

** **

**Trade Entangled with Politics**

Even as we argued over sovereignty, trade tied us together. Russian ships needed supplies, and our missions and ranchos often benefited from their goods. Grain, cattle, and hides passed one way, while tools and manufactured items came the other. These exchanges softened tensions but also complicated negotiations, for to sever ties would hurt both sides. Diplomacy was shaped not only by politics but also by the reality of shared needs.

 

**My Role on the Frontier**

As comandante of the northern frontier, I often stood at the center of these negotiations. My duty was to uphold Mexico’s claims while keeping peace along our borders. I made it clear that the Russians must never expand beyond their fort, and I watched carefully for any sign that they sought to push southward. At the same time, I dealt with them as neighbors, sometimes trading and sometimes warning, always mindful that our words carried the weight of fragile authority.

** **

**The Gradual Resolution**

By the 1830s it became clear that the Russians faced struggles of their own. Their crops failed, their hunting profits declined, and their company no longer saw Fort Ross as worth the cost. Diplomacy shifted from arguments over sovereignty to discussions of withdrawal. At last, in 1841, they agreed to sell their holdings to John Sutter and abandon their post. This was not the result of Mexican force but of Russian weakness, yet it was still a victory for our claim.

** **

**The Lessons of Negotiation**

These negotiations taught us much about the limits of power on a distant frontier. Mexico lacked the strength to remove the Russians by arms, but through patience, diplomacy, and the weight of circumstance, we saw them depart. For me, it was proof that leadership requires both vigilance and restraint, for sometimes victory comes not through battle but through endurance.

 

 

**Decision to Abandon Fort Ross (1841) – Told by Ivan Kuskov**

When we first built Fort Ross in 1812, we believed it would become the lifeline of Russian America. The land seemed fertile, the sea abundant, and the position strong. Yet as the years passed, the promise of the settlement grew dim. Crops did not yield enough to feed our northern colonies, the climate proved harsher than expected for farming, and the costs of keeping the fort mounted beyond what the company could bear.

** **

**The Collapse of the Fur Trade**

The sea otter, whose pelts once brought immense wealth, became scarce along the California coast. Hunters traveled farther for fewer returns, and the very foundation of our trade crumbled. Without the profits of furs, the Russian-American Company had little reason to continue pouring resources into a distant and struggling colony. The dream of sustaining Alaska through California’s harvests no longer matched the reality we faced each year.

** **

**Growing Isolation and Pressur**

We were also increasingly isolated. The Spanish and later the Mexicans considered us intruders, and though open conflict never came, the constant watchfulness and restrictions limited our growth. Foreign merchants from Britain and America competed in trade, and we could not match their reach or resources. Fort Ross became a lonely outpost, caught between empires, too far from Russia to receive steady aid, and too costly to stand on its own.

** **

**The Company’s Decision**

By the late 1830s, the leaders of the Russian-American Company could no longer justify the expense. Reports of poor harvests, high costs, and little profit filled their records. At last, in 1841, the decision was made: Fort Ross would be abandoned. The company sought a buyer, and John Sutter, a Swiss settler in the Sacramento Valley, agreed to purchase the buildings, livestock, and supplies. The settlement we had built with so much effort was sold, its future handed to others.

 

**My Reflections on the Departure**

Though I had returned to Russia before this decision was final, the abandonment of Fort Ross weighed heavily on me. I had devoted my life to building the colony, believing it could secure Russia’s place in California. To see it given up was a bitter reminder of the limits of our reach and the power of distance, scarcity, and time. Yet I also knew that no empire could hold a land forever without the strength to sustain it. Fort Ross was a chapter of ambition, struggle, and loss, and though it ended in departure, it left a mark on the history of the Pacific.

 

 

**My Name is John Sutter: Pioneer and Landowner of California**

I was born in 1803 in Kandern, Switzerland. My early years were not those of wealth or power, and I longed for opportunity beyond the confines of Europe. The stories of America stirred my imagination, tales of vast lands and fresh beginnings. In 1834 I left my family behind and sailed across the Atlantic. I traveled through New York, Missouri, and even to Hawaii before I found myself drawn to the distant province of Alta California.

** **

**Arrival in California**

In 1839 I arrived in California, then still under Mexican control. I was granted land in the Sacramento Valley, where I dreamed of building a great settlement. I called it New Helvetia, after my Swiss homeland. There I built Sutter’s Fort, which became a hub for travelers, traders, and settlers. I worked to create a place of industry and farming, hiring Native laborers, welcoming foreigners, and carving out a small empire on the frontier.

** **

**The Purchase of Fort Ross**

In 1841 the Russians decided to abandon Fort Ross, their lonely outpost on the Pacific coast. They could no longer sustain it, and I saw the opportunity to expand my holdings. I purchased the fort, along with livestock and supplies, from the Russian-American Company. Though the coastal lands were difficult to farm, the purchase brought me recognition and influence. Fort Ross no longer flew the Russian flag, but its history was added to my own story.

** **

**The Changing of Nations**

Soon after, California changed hands once again. The Mexican government weakened, and American influence grew stronger. By 1846, during the Mexican-American War, my fort became a center of American activity. I pledged support to the newcomers, hoping to protect my lands and secure my position in the new order. Yet with each change of government came new challenges, as promises were made and broken, and titles to land were often disputed.

** **

**The Gold Rush and Ruin**

In 1848, workers at my mill in Coloma discovered gold. That moment would transform California forever. Thousands upon thousands of people flooded into the land, driven by dreams of riches. For me, it was a curse. The flood of fortune-seekers destroyed my fields, overran my lands, and ignored my claims. Though I had been called a great pioneer, I found myself powerless against the tide of history.

** **

**My Final Years**

I lived until 1880, long enough to see California grow from a distant frontier into one of the most important states of the Union. Yet my own fortunes dwindled. I lost much of what I had built and spent my later years seeking recognition and justice for my contributions. I will be remembered for many things: as a builder of forts, as the man who purchased Fort Ross, and as the one whose land gave birth to the California Gold Rush. My life was filled with both ambition and disappointment, a story bound to the restless spirit of the age.

 

 

**Sale of Fort Ross to John Sutter – Told by John Sutter**

By the early 1840s, the Russians at Fort Ross had grown weary of their struggle. Their fur trade had collapsed, their farming failed to supply Alaska, and the cost of maintaining the settlement became too heavy. Word reached me that they were ready to leave California behind, and I knew at once that this was an opportunity I could not ignore.

** **

**Negotiations with the Russians**

I entered discussions with the Russian-American Company to purchase their holdings. They offered me not only the buildings of Fort Ross but also livestock, tools, and supplies. We spread maps on the table, traced boundaries, and weighed the value of what remained. For the Russians, it was a way to recover some cost before abandoning the colony. For me, it was a chance to expand my influence in California and strengthen my growing settlement at New Helvetia.

 

**The Terms of the Sale**

In 1841, the agreement was made. I purchased Fort Ross and all that it contained. The redwood walls, the chapel, the blockhouses, and the fertile but contested lands became mine. Thousands of cattle, sheep, and agricultural equipment were also transferred to my control. The Russians sailed away, leaving behind what they had built over nearly thirty years, and I stepped in to claim it as my own.

** **

**The Fort’s Changing Purpose**

For me, Fort Ross was not meant to be a military outpost as it had been for the Russians. Instead, it became a resource, a place to supply goods, livestock, and materials for New Helvetia in the Sacramento Valley. The fort lost its old identity as a symbol of empire and became instead a tool for private enterprise. Its walls still stood strong, but its meaning shifted with the change in hands.

 

**The Legacy of the Purchase**

The sale of Fort Ross marked the end of Russia’s ambitions in California and the growth of my own. It was a turning point, showing how the land of California was passing from one empire to another, and finally into the hands of men like me, foreigners who carved out new futures. Though the fort would later fall quiet, its story is bound forever to mine, for I was the one who took it over when Russia let it go.

 

 

**Integration of the Fort into Mexican and American California – Told by Vallejo**

When the Russians left Fort Ross in 1841, the land and its buildings did not disappear. Instead, they passed into the hands of John Sutter, a foreign settler who was already building his influence in the Sacramento Valley. For Mexico, the Russian departure was a relief, for it ended a long-standing challenge to our sovereignty. Yet the fort’s new owner was not Mexican by birth, and his presence reflected the growing tide of foreigners who were reshaping California’s future.

** **

**Mexican Authority in Transition**

During these years, Mexico struggled to maintain true control over California. Our government in Mexico City was distant and weak, leaving us on the frontier to manage as best we could. As comandante, I worked to keep order and uphold our claims, but settlers like Sutter operated with great independence. The purchase of Fort Ross by a private individual showed how little direct power the Mexican state truly held over its northern lands.

** **

**A Place of Many Uses**

Under Sutter’s ownership, the fort became less a military outpost and more a resource. Its buildings, livestock, and supplies were put to use for trade, farming, and expansion into the interior valleys. The fort no longer served as a symbol of empire but instead became a tool in the ambitions of individuals. It was a sign that California’s destiny was shifting away from old powers and toward new ones who were drawn by opportunity rather than loyalty to a distant crown.

** **

**The Coming of the Americans**

Only a few years later, war broke out between Mexico and the United States. By 1848, California passed into American hands, and Fort Ross, like the rest of the province, was absorbed into this new nation. What had once been Russian, then Mexican by claim, and briefly tied to Sutter’s private ventures, now became part of the American state of California. The fort’s walls still stood, but its meaning changed with each flag that flew over it.

** **

**My Reflections on the Transition**

I lived long enough to see all these changes unfold. To me, Fort Ross was always a reminder of how fragile control can be on a distant frontier. It began as a Russian colony, was claimed by Mexico, and ended under American rule, all within the span of my life. Its integration into California’s story shows how power shifts, how nations rise and fall, and how places endure even as their purpose changes. For the Kashaya Pomo, for Mexico, for Russia, and for America, the fort carries a legacy that belongs to all and yet to none.

 

 

**The Legacy of Fort Ross for Native Peoples – Told by Chief Kashaya Pomo**

When the Russians built Fort Ross, they did not simply raise wooden walls. They left a mark on our land and on the lives of our people. For generations, we had lived freely along the coast, following the seasons, guided by the knowledge of our ancestors. The fort changed that rhythm. It brought new tools and new ideas, but it also brought disease, labor demands, and the loss of hunting and fishing grounds. The legacy of the fort cannot be separated from these changes.

** **

**Memories of Exchange and Struggle**

Some of our people remember the Russians as traders who gave us cloth, beads, and metal in return for our work. Others remember them as outsiders who drained the land and sea of life and disrupted the harmony of our villages. The truth lies in both memories. There was exchange, and there was struggle. The fort taught us new skills, yet it also reminded us of how quickly a powerful presence could shift the balance of our world.

** **

**The Wounds of Sickness and Loss**

One of the heaviest legacies was the sickness that came with the newcomers. Illness spread through our villages and took many lives. These wounds were not healed when the Russians left, nor when others came after them. They remain part of our story, passed down in sorrowful memory, a reminder of what contact with foreigners cost our people.

** **

**The Strength of Survival**

Yet the fort did not end us. We Kashaya remained, holding fast to our traditions and our ties to the land. Even as others claimed authority—first Mexico, then America—we stayed rooted in the coast, the rivers, and the forests of our ancestors. The legacy of Fort Ross is not only one of loss but also one of endurance. We adapted, we survived, and we carried our culture forward despite the weight of change.

 

**The Fort Today**

Now, when people visit the fort, they see the walls and the chapel and speak of Russia, Mexico, or America. But we see something more. We see the memory of our ancestors, the hardships they endured, and the strength they passed on. For Native peoples, Fort Ross is not just a story of empire. It is part of our story—a reminder that we were here before it was built, that we endured through its years, and that we remain long after the foreign flags have come down.

 

 

**The Historical Significance of Fort Ross Today – Told by Ivan Kuskov, Mariano Vallejo, John Sutter, and Chief Kashaya Pomo**

**The Vision of Russia – Told by Ivan Kuskov: ***When I look upon Fort Ross today, I see the dream we carried across the Pacific. It was not only wood and stone but a statement that Russia sought a place in this distant land. Though the fort was eventually abandoned, its walls still remind the world that we reached beyond Siberia and Alaska to touch the fertile soil of California. Its significance lies in showing how far our ambition traveled, even if our empire could not hold it.*

** **

**The Struggle of Sovereignty – Told by Mariano Vallejo**: *For me, the fort is a reminder of Mexico’s challenge to defend its frontiers. The presence of the Russians tested our sovereignty, and though we lacked the force to remove them, we endured until time and circumstance led to their departure. Fort Ross stands as proof of how fragile borders can be and how diplomacy and endurance sometimes serve in place of armies. Its history reflects the larger struggle of nations to hold authority over distant lands.*

** **

**The Tide of Change – Told by John Sutter**: *When I purchased Fort Ross, it was no longer a symbol of empire but a tool for expansion. Its resources aided my own endeavors, and its story became woven into the transformation of California. Soon after, the discovery of gold shifted everything, and the fort became a quiet echo of a past overtaken by the rush of newcomers. Its significance now is as a marker of how quickly power and purpose can change, and how California passed from Russian hands, to Mexican claims, and finally to the United States.*

** **

**The Memory of Survival – Told by Chief Kashaya Pomo**: *For my people, the fort holds a different meaning. It reminds us of hardship, of sickness, and of labor given to strangers. Yet it also reminds us of survival. We lived here before the fort was built, we endured during its years, and we remain long after the Russians, Mexicans, and Americans claimed it as their own. Its walls speak not only of foreign empires but of the Kashaya, who still call this land home. For us, the significance of Fort Ross lies in memory, resilience, and the unbroken bond to our homeland.*

** **

**The Shared Legacy – Told Together**: *Fort Ross today stands as a place where many histories meet. It tells of Russian ambition, Mexican defense, American expansion, and Native endurance. No single story alone can capture its meaning, for it is the intersection of all these voices. Its historical significance lies not only in the empire it once served but in the reminder that this land has always been contested, lived in, and remembered by many. To walk within its walls is to walk through the layered past of California, where nations rose and fell, and where people endured.*
