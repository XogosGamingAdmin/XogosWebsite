**My Name is Andrew Jackson: Seventh President of the United States**

I was born in 1767 in a rough log cabin along the border of North and South Carolina. My parents were poor Irish immigrants who had little more than faith and grit. My father died before I was born, and by the time I was thirteen, I had lost my mother and two brothers to war and disease. I grew up knowing hardship, and from an early age, I understood that if I wanted to survive, I would have to fight for everything I ever hoped to have. There was no inheritance, no security—just my will and determination.

**Starting from Nothing**

After the Revolutionary War, I had no family and no money. I worked odd jobs, studying law on my own while helping around a local attorney’s office. Every book I read and every case I observed became a lesson in how to rise above poverty. In 1787, I became a lawyer and moved west to Tennessee, where opportunity was growing for men who weren’t afraid of hard work. I started with little more than a horse, a few coins, and ambition. Slowly, I began to build my reputation and savings.

** **

**Building a Career**

Law became my first step toward stability. I was known for being fierce in the courtroom—unwilling to back down from anyone. My skill and persistence led to positions as a public prosecutor and eventually as a judge. I learned that your career is often built on how much people can trust your resolve and how well you deliver results. Every dollar I earned was hard-won, and I saved and invested in land, which became my foundation for wealth.

** **

**Facing Opposition and Proving Worth**

Nothing ever came easy. I was criticized for being uneducated, rough around the edges, and not part of the “elite.” But I didn’t let their words stop me. I turned every insult into motivation. I served in the military and gained national fame after the Battle of New Orleans. My leadership was not polished, but it was honest, and I earned respect through action, not wealth or status.

** **

**Money, Power, and Principles**

As president, I saw how the wealthy and powerful controlled much of America’s money through private banks. I believed the Bank of the United States gave too much power to the few and too little to the people. So I fought it. My decision to destroy that bank made me enemies among the rich, but it kept money in the hands of the people and strengthened the idea that opportunity belongs to all, not just the privileged.

** **

**Lessons from My Life**

I began life with nothing—no family, no education, and no money. What I did have was determination and a belief that no one else would shape my future for me. I learned that education, even if self-taught, is the key to progress. I learned that every career requires courage to face rejection, resilience to push through failure, and wisdom to stand by your principles when others try to buy your silence. My story is proof that you don’t need to be born into wealth to shape history; you only need to work harder than anyone else and never stop fighting for your place in it.

 

 

**Discovering Your Interests and Strengths – Told by Andrew Jackson**

When I was a boy, I had little guidance and even fewer choices. My early years were filled with hardship, and my first interest was simply survival. Yet even in those days, I felt a fire in me—a desire to prove that a man’s worth was not determined by where he was born but by what he could do. That feeling became my first clue about my strengths. It wasn’t about skill at the time but spirit. Every young person has that inner spark, that thing that makes them want to act or achieve. If you can recognize it early, you can shape your entire life around it.

 

I learned through trial and error. I was not skilled with my hands like a craftsman, nor did I have a merchant’s patience for trade. But I could argue. I could stand my ground, persuade others, and command attention. Those were not things taught to me—they were instincts I had to recognize. Once I did, I knew that my interests lay in leadership and justice, not in quiet labor. Discovering your interests is not about finding what’s easy—it’s about finding what makes you feel alive.

**Exploring Your Natural Strengths**

If I were speaking to a class of students today, I’d tell them to think about what comes naturally when facing a challenge. Do you organize others? Solve problems? Inspire people? Those patterns reveal strengths that can be molded into careers. My strength was determination and the will to lead. I was never the smartest in the room, but I was often the most driven. Determination became my skill, and over time, leadership became my craft.

 

You can discover your strengths by looking at how you respond to real situations. When something goes wrong, do you give up, or do you find another way? If you naturally help others, perhaps your future lies in teaching or medicine. If you love taking things apart to see how they work, perhaps engineering or mechanics would suit you. The key is not to compare yourself to others, but to look inward. Every person is built with a different purpose, and it takes reflection to uncover it.

** **

**Activities to Find Your Path**

There are ways to make this discovery easier. One method is an interest inventory—write down the things that make you excited or curious. Then list what you do well. Compare the two lists and look for overlap. When I was young, I didn’t have such exercises, but if I had, I might have realized much sooner that my calling was in defending people’s rights.

 

Another method is a skill-matching chart. List skills you already have—perhaps speaking, building, writing, or designing—and match them with careers that use those skills. You’ll start to see patterns emerge. When I first began studying law, I didn’t yet know it would shape my destiny. But I had the skill to persuade and the drive to fight for fairness. Law simply gave my strengths a direction.

 

Personality-career quizzes can also help. They aren’t perfect, but they help you see yourself from a new angle. If you enjoy competition and problem-solving, you may thrive in business or leadership. If you value creativity and expression, you might find fulfillment in the arts. The important part is that you take time to reflect and experiment.

** **

**Learning Through Experience**

No test or chart can tell you everything. You discover your interests through doing. My first jobs were rough—hard labor, messenger work, and odd tasks. None of them felt right, but each one taught me something about myself. I learned I needed a role where I could make decisions and see progress. You must try many paths before you find the one that fits. Every experience, even a bad one, teaches you what to avoid or what to pursue next.

 

Volunteering, shadowing someone at work, or starting a small project can show you more than years of guessing. If you think you’d like to be a teacher, help younger students study. If you dream of design, start a small art project or business. Discovery comes from doing, not waiting.

** **

**Turning Strengths into a Career**

Once you recognize your interests and strengths, the next step is to build on them. Train your natural abilities until they become professional skills. I once relied on my confidence and speaking ability, but studying law turned those strengths into a respected career. I invested time, energy, and focus until my skills earned me a living. Your interests give you direction, but your discipline gives you success.

 

Success isn’t found in chasing what others say is profitable—it’s in pursuing what matches your strengths. The world needs thinkers, creators, builders, healers, and leaders alike. You must decide which one you are.

** **

**My Final Advice**

When I look back at my life, I see that the greatest discovery was not money or power—it was purpose. I found out who I was and built a career that let me use my strengths for something greater. You may not know right now what your purpose is, but the clues are all around you in the things that excite and challenge you. Write them down. Test them. Build upon them.

 

Every person, no matter their beginnings, has something the world needs. Your task is to find it, strengthen it, and use it wisely. That is how you build not only a career but a life worth remembering.

 

 

**Researching Career Options**

When I was young, I thought career research meant picking a single job and sticking with it for life. I later learned that it’s more like exploring a landscape—you start walking in one direction, learn what you like, and sometimes take a new path when you see something better. The truth is, most people don’t know exactly what they want to do at first. But those who take time to research and explore end up finding work that fits their personality, skills, and values. You don’t need to have it all figured out; you just need to be curious enough to start looking.

 

When I first began working on my educational games, I didn’t see it as a career. I was just trying to make learning fun. But because I understood the skills I was building—storytelling, marketing, product design—it grew into something real. That’s what research does: it connects your interests with real opportunities that you may not even realize exist.

** **

**Using Tools to Explore the Possibilities**

Today, you have more tools at your fingertips than any generation before you. One of the best is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook. It’s like a career encyclopedia that breaks down what every job actually involves—how much people earn, how fast the field is growing, and what kind of education or skills you need to get started. Spend time there. Search jobs you’ve heard of, and a few you haven’t. Read the descriptions, look at the daily tasks, and imagine yourself doing them.

 

There are also job search sites like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn. They don’t just show openings; they show trends. What jobs are hiring in your area? What qualifications are most requested? What do people actually say about working in those roles? That information helps you make smarter choices before you invest years of study or training.

** **

**Creating Your Own Industry**

The world doesn’t stop at traditional jobs. You can create your own career just as easily as you can find one. When I built Historical Conquest, there was no “educational card game” career path. I made one. Every industry you see began because someone decided to solve a problem or make something people didn’t know they needed. If you love to code, you might invent an app that changes how students study. If you love fashion, you might start a brand that teaches sustainability through clothing design. Researching careers also means researching *gaps*—areas where something is missing. Those gaps are opportunities waiting for creative people to step in.

** **

**Connecting Education to Your Goals**

Students often ask why they should care about certain classes. The answer becomes clear once you have a goal. When you know you want to be a game designer, you start to see why math matters. When you dream of becoming a marine biologist, science and writing suddenly have purpose. Education is more enjoyable when it’s connected to something you care about. You don’t need a finished plan—you just need a direction. Having that goal in mind gives meaning to every skill you learn along the way.

 

Whether it’s high school, college, or an apprenticeship, your education is your launchpad. The more you know about your destination, the easier it is to plot the route.

**Making a Plan and Taking Action**

Researching careers isn’t just reading about them—it’s testing them. Talk to people who do the job you’re curious about. Ask them what they love, what’s difficult, and how they got started. Volunteer, intern, or shadow someone for a day. You’ll learn more from one real-world experience than from hours of reading. And if you realize it’s not the right path, that’s not failure—that’s valuable information guiding you toward something better.

 

Keep notes on what excites you, what bores you, and what challenges you. Over time, you’ll start to see a pattern of where you belong.

** **

**Final Thoughts**

You have a world of possibilities waiting for you, but opportunity doesn’t find you—you find it. Take time to explore, research, and ask questions. Don’t let anyone tell you that your dream is too unusual or unrealistic. Every career that exists today began with someone daring to imagine something new. The sooner you start researching and experimenting, the sooner you’ll find that spark that tells you, “This is it.” And once you do, your education, your goals, and your future will all start to align in ways that make life far more meaningful.

 

 

**Comparing Income vs. Cost of Living – Told by Zack Edwards**

When I got my first major paycheck, I thought I had made it. The number looked huge compared to anything I’d earned before. But after a few months of rent, gas, groceries, and bills, I realized something: the number on your paycheck means nothing if you don’t understand how far that money goes where you live. That’s the secret behind comparing income to cost of living. Two people can make the same salary, but one can feel wealthy while the other struggles—simply because of where they live.

 

Cost of living isn’t just a number; it’s the invisible price tag attached to your lifestyle. Food, housing, transportation, insurance, taxes—these vary dramatically from one city or state to another. A $60,000 salary in Kansas might give you a comfortable home, two cars, and extra savings. That same salary in New York City might barely cover a studio apartment and public transportation.

** **

**Understanding How Location Changes Everything**

When you look at a job offer or plan for your future, don’t just ask, “How much will I make?” Ask, “How much will it cost to live there?” The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and sites like Numbeo or NerdWallet have cost-of-living calculators that compare the real value of money across cities. You can enter a salary and see what it’s equivalent to somewhere else. For example, earning $50,000 in Dallas might feel like $80,000 in Los Angeles once housing and taxes are factored in.

 

Taxes alone can change everything. Some states, like Florida or Texas, have no state income tax, which means you keep more of what you earn. Others, like California or New York, take a larger percentage but often offer higher wages to balance it out. The smart move is to compare both sides of the equation before you decide where to live or accept a job.

** **

**Evaluating Lifestyle Choices**

Money isn’t just about surviving—it’s about the kind of life you want to live. Before you choose a career or location, picture your lifestyle. Do you want a small home in a peaceful rural town or a busy apartment in the heart of the city? Are you content cooking at home and hiking on weekends, or do you love dining out and entertainment? Every choice you make has a financial weight.

 

I learned this firsthand when I moved my business. I had to compare not only office rent and utilities, but also employee wages, gas prices, and even how much it cost for a sandwich at lunch. It sounds simple, but those details add up quickly. What I realized is that living “well” means balancing comfort and opportunity—not just chasing the highest income.

** **

**The Real Value of Money**

A high salary can look exciting, but it’s not the same as high value. If you make $100,000 in a city where rent is $3,500 a month, you might be worse off than someone making $60,000 where rent is $900. That’s why it’s so important to calculate what’s left after taxes and essentials. Write it down: rent or mortgage, utilities, transportation, food, healthcare, and personal spending. Once you subtract all those costs, you’ll know your *real income*—the amount that determines your lifestyle.

 

Some people discover they can live happier lives in smaller towns or different states simply because their money stretches further. Others accept higher costs because their career opportunities or passions lie in big cities. Neither is wrong, but both require awareness.

** **

**Tools and Strategies for Comparison**

Let me give you a practical way to think about it. Start with a cost-of-living calculator online. Enter a city you want to live in and your expected salary. Then compare it to another city. Look at the differences in housing, groceries, transportation, and healthcare. You might find that a lower-paying job in a more affordable city actually leaves you with more savings.

 

You can also use government data or local salary reports. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes average wages by occupation and region. Cross-check that with housing sites like Zillow or [Apartments.com](http://Apartments.com) to see rent prices. A little research like this can save you years of financial stress.

** **

**Balancing Opportunity and Affordability**

When I talk to students, I tell them not to chase money blindly. Instead, chase opportunity and balance. Sometimes it’s worth starting in a more expensive city if you’ll gain experience and connections that open doors later. Other times, you’re better off in a smaller market where you can live comfortably and save early. It’s not just about where you start, but how you use what you have to build toward where you want to go.

 

I’ve known people who took lower-paying jobs in affordable cities and used the difference to start small businesses or invest. I’ve also known people who earned high salaries in expensive areas but lived paycheck to paycheck because they didn’t plan. Your location is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll ever make.

** **

**The Takeaway: Know What You’re Worth and Where You’ll Thrive**

At the end of the day, comparing income and cost of living is about more than math—it’s about values. What do you want your life to look like? How much freedom do you want? How important is owning a home, traveling, or starting a business? When you research jobs, also research the cities they’re in. Look beyond the paycheck and see the full picture of your potential life there.

 

If you do that, you’ll never be fooled by a flashy salary or a glamorous offer. You’ll make decisions based on understanding, not impulse. That’s how you build not just a career, but a sustainable and fulfilling life—one where every dollar works for you, no matter where you live.

 

 

**My Name is Soichiro Honda: Founder of Honda Motor Company**

I was born in 1906 in a small village in Japan, far from the great cities and factories that would later change my life. My father was a blacksmith and bicycle repairman, and my mother wove cloth to help our family survive. We did not have much money, but I grew up surrounded by tools, machines, and the sound of metal being shaped by hand. That sound became my music. From the time I could walk, I loved the smell of oil and the feel of steel. I didn’t know it then, but those early days in my father’s shop were building the foundation for everything I would become.

** **

**A Young Dreamer with Dirty Hands**

When I was fifteen, I left home to work as an apprentice in an auto repair shop in Tokyo. I had no formal education beyond elementary school, and I knew little about the world, but I had an endless curiosity. I swept floors, cleaned engines, and worked until my hands were raw. Every moment was a chance to learn. I spent my nights studying how machines worked, not in books, but by taking them apart. I wasn’t chasing money—I was chasing understanding.

 

Those years were hard. I earned almost nothing, slept in small quarters above the shop, and often went hungry. But I didn’t complain. Every job, no matter how small, brought me closer to mastering my craft. I believed that skill would eventually earn its own reward.

** **

**Building from Nothing**

After years of working for others, I decided to start my own business. I began with almost no money, just determination and a pile of used parts. I founded a small workshop that produced piston rings for car engines. I thought it would be easy, but it was a disaster. My first designs failed, my materials were poor, and I nearly went bankrupt. But failure taught me more than success ever could. I went back to school to learn metallurgy, spending years perfecting the strength and precision of my piston rings.

 

When I finally produced a successful design, I sold it to Toyota. But before I could grow my business, a bomb destroyed my factory during World War II. I had nothing left—no money, no machines, no employees. Most people would have given up. I chose to rebuild. I collected gasoline cans and metal scraps left behind by the war and used them to make new equipment. That’s when I started making small engines that could attach to bicycles. People needed a cheap way to get around, and I gave it to them. That small idea became the beginning of Honda Motor Company.

** **

**Fighting Opposition and Doubt**

Not everyone believed in my dream. Japan’s economy was in ruins, and many thought my motorized bicycles were foolish. Banks refused to loan me money, and manufacturers laughed at my designs. But I believed in what I was building. I wanted to create machines that made people’s lives better—machines that were reliable, affordable, and fun to use.

 

When I introduced the first Honda motorcycles, competitors mocked their small size. They called them toys. Yet, people loved them because they were practical and dependable. Soon, demand grew, and Honda motorcycles began to appear all across Japan. I had fought my way from poverty to leadership in an industry that once rejected me.

** **

**Money and Meaning**

For me, money was never the goal—it was a tool. I believed that profit comes naturally when you make something valuable for others. I invested my earnings back into research, testing, and education for my employees. I always said that success belongs to those who improve themselves daily, not to those who chase wealth alone. My focus was on quality and innovation. That mindset helped Honda grow from a small workshop into a global company known for excellence.

 

Even as we expanded to cars, I refused to take shortcuts. When people told me I couldn’t compete with giants like Toyota or Ford, I smiled. I had heard those words my entire life. Opposition only strengthened my resolve. We built the Honda Civic, the Accord, and many other models that challenged the world’s biggest automakers.

** **

**Lessons from My Journey**

I began life as a poor boy with dirty hands and a curious mind. I didn’t have a fancy education or wealthy investors, but I had perseverance. I learned that real success is not about where you start but how much you’re willing to learn and how hard you’re willing to work. Every failure became a lesson, every obstacle a stepping stone.

 

If there’s one thing I hope others remember, it’s this: don’t let your circumstances decide your future. Use them as fuel. Build your skills, follow your curiosity, and stay true to your values. You can create your own career, your own path, and even your own industry if you dare to keep building when everyone else has stopped. That was my story—and that is the power of persistence, purpose, and hard work.

 

 

**Developing In-Demand Skills – Told by Soichiro Honda**

When I was a young man, no one handed me a list of skills to study. I learned by doing, by breaking things, and by fixing them again. In the world of work, no matter what century you live in, those who act and learn through experience rise above those who only talk. Skills—both soft and hard—are the bridge between dreams and success. When I built my first workshop, I didn’t know the language of business or design. I only knew that I wanted to make things that worked better than before. That curiosity became my most valuable skill.

**The Power of Soft Skills**

Many people think success is all about what you can build with your hands, but your mind and heart are just as important. The first set of abilities every worker must master are what you call soft skills. These are things that help you work with others and overcome problems that don’t require a wrench or a machine. Communication, for example, was not something I learned easily. I was impatient, and when workers failed, I often shouted. But over time, I realized that great ideas are worthless if you can’t share them in a way others understand. Communication allows teams to function like a well-oiled engine.

 

Teamwork was another lesson I learned the hard way. I once tried to do everything myself—design, production, even sales. But no matter how skilled one person may be, progress comes faster when you work with others who share your vision. Teamwork is not about agreement; it’s about harmony. In a good team, each person plays a part, like different gears working toward the same purpose.

 

Adaptability might be the most valuable soft skill of all. The world changes faster than any machine I ever built. Materials shift, markets evolve, and technology leaps ahead. Those who cling to the past are left behind. I had to adapt when my factory was destroyed during the war, when the market shifted to automobiles, and when competition grew fierce. Each time, I reminded myself: the skill that never becomes outdated is the ability to change.

 

**Mastering Hard Skills**

While soft skills open doors, hard skills keep them open. In my life, hard skills were everything—mechanical engineering, metalwork, and later, understanding combustion engines. For students today, hard skills also include digital literacy, programming, and data analysis, as much as craftsmanship and design. The tools may have changed, but the mindset is the same: learn to understand how things work, not just how to use them.

 

Trade-specific knowledge gives you confidence and independence. When you know how to design, fix, or build something, you hold power that no one can take away. For me, that meant being able to build a new machine when one broke. For you, it might mean learning how to code, how to operate machinery, or how to analyze financial data. Employers seek people who can solve real problems, not just repeat instructions.

** **

**How Students Can Begin Now**

You don’t need a job title or a diploma to start developing these skills. Begin where you are. Join a school club, volunteer for a project, or take on something difficult that requires teamwork. These experiences teach communication, patience, and problem-solving better than any lecture. If you have access to technology, learn how to use it creatively. Try building something from scratch—whether it’s a website, a motor, or a small business idea. Every mistake you make adds to your skill set.

 

Read about the fields that interest you, but don’t stop there. Watch people who are good at what they do. Ask questions, experiment, and don’t be afraid to fail. Skills develop faster when you practice them in real life. If you are naturally shy, practice speaking up in small groups. If you struggle with organization, learn to plan your time and manage small projects. Each small improvement becomes part of your foundation.

 

**Combining Heart and Hands**

The greatest workers I ever hired were not the ones with the best grades—they were the ones who cared about learning. They asked questions, took pride in their craft, and wanted to do things better each time. Skills are not just tools for a job; they are expressions of who you are. Employers look for those who show initiative, creativity, and humility—the willingness to learn from anyone, even those below them.

 

When you develop both your heart and your hands, you become unstoppable. Communication helps you connect, adaptability helps you endure, and hard skills help you perform. Together, they form the foundation of every successful career.

** **

**My Advice to the Next Generation**

When I began, I was a poor mechanic in a broken world. I did not wait for the perfect chance or the perfect training. I started where I was, used what I had, and learned everything I could. You can do the same. Choose one skill to master this month, one new challenge to accept, one fear to overcome. Skills don’t grow by luck—they grow by effort.

 

If you keep improving yourself every day, you will find that opportunities begin to chase you instead of the other way around. And when they do, you will be ready—not because of luck or privilege, but because of the skills you built with your own determination. That, more than anything, is what the world truly demands.

 

 

**Building Experience Before the Job – Told by Soichiro Honda**

When I first began dreaming about engines and machines, I had no qualifications, no formal training, and no company willing to hire me as a designer. I did not wait for permission to start. I began where I was—with what I had. Experience is not something that arrives after you get a job; it is something you build before anyone pays you for it. Every project, every repair, and every experiment I attempted before owning a factory was part of my training. Students today can do the same. You don’t need to wait for a title or a paycheck to start learning and building.

**The Power of Apprenticeship and Internships**

When I was fifteen, I became an apprentice at a small auto repair shop in Tokyo. My tasks were simple—cleaning floors, fetching tools, and observing real mechanics at work. It was not glamorous, but it was priceless. I was not earning much money, but I was earning something far more valuable—skills and understanding. Today, apprenticeships and internships offer the same kind of opportunity. You may not make much at first, but you gain hands-on experience that no classroom can match.

 

If you can find a local shop, business, or mentor who will let you learn by helping, take that chance. You will see the daily rhythm of a career and the realities of the work long before others even begin. Internships show employers that you are serious, disciplined, and willing to learn from the ground up.

 

**Volunteering and Personal Projects**

When there was no one to hire me, I still found ways to work. I repaired bicycles in my village, built homemade engines, and created parts from scrap. I wasn’t being paid, but I was proving to myself that I could solve problems with my own hands. Volunteer work and personal projects do the same today. They show initiative, creativity, and perseverance.

 

If you want to design games, make one for fun. If you want to teach, volunteer to tutor younger students. If you love engineering, build something small with what you have. Even if your project fails, the experience will teach you more than success ever could. Every unpaid hour of effort builds confidence and skill.

** **

**Part-Time Jobs That Build Character**

Not every experience will seem connected to your dream career at first. I worked odd jobs, fixing things that seemed insignificant. But I learned punctuality, reliability, and the importance of doing work well, even when no one was watching. A part-time job, whether in a shop, a restaurant, or a warehouse, can teach discipline and teamwork. Employers notice people who show up, work hard, and think ahead. These habits will follow you into every future opportunity.

 

Sometimes, the most ordinary jobs reveal what kind of worker you truly are. They test your patience, your responsibility, and your ability to balance multiple tasks. These are traits that matter in any career, no matter how technical or advanced.

** **

**Showcasing Your Experience**

In my day, my workshop was my portfolio. Every piston, engine, or motor I made was a message to the world saying, “This is what I can do.” Students today have even more ways to show what they’ve built. An online portfolio, a social media page, or a digital record of your projects can show future employers your growth and creativity.

 

Keep photos, designs, and descriptions of what you’ve made or helped with. Share the story of what you learned and how you improved. A good employer doesn’t just want to see results—they want to see the journey. When you can demonstrate that you’ve taken initiative, even without pay, you show that you don’t wait for opportunity—you create it.

** **

**Learning Beyond the Classroom**

Classroom learning gives you theory, but the world rewards action. You can read about engines for years and still not know how to build one until you get your hands dirty. The same applies to every field—medicine, art, technology, or business. Real-world experience sharpens your instincts, builds your resilience, and helps you understand how people and systems truly work.

 

Find ways to connect what you learn in school to real problems. If you study science, try an experiment at home. If you study business, help a friend promote their small venture. Each experience builds layers of understanding that will prepare you for the career you want.

** **

**My Final Advice**

Experience is not about waiting for your chance—it’s about creating it. Every small effort, every late night, every volunteer hour adds up. You are building your resume long before you print it on paper. The more you practice your craft before you’re paid for it, the more valuable you become when someone finally does hire you.

 

In my life, I learned that real experience doesn’t start when someone opens the door for you—it starts when you begin knocking. So start now. Take every chance to work, build, create, and learn. The sooner you begin, the faster you’ll discover not only what you can do, but who you can become.

 

 

**Understanding Pay Structures – Told by Zack Edwards**

When I got my first job, I was thrilled just to see money coming into my account. But over time, I learned that not all pay is equal, even when the numbers look the same. The way you’re paid—whether hourly, salary, or through commissions and bonuses—can completely change how you manage your time and your life. Understanding pay structures isn’t just about math; it’s about knowing the value of your hours and what kind of work environment fits your goals.

** **

**Hourly Pay: Trading Time for Money**

Hourly pay is the most straightforward system—you get paid for the hours you work. When you’re young and don’t have a lot of responsibilities, this can be an excellent setup, especially if the hourly rate is fair. If your employer offers overtime pay, usually called “time and a half,” take advantage of it while you can. Those extra hours can add up to thousands of dollars a year. Instead of spending that extra money right away, set it aside for something meaningful—like a college fund, a business idea, or an investment account.

 

Hourly pay gives you control over your schedule and the ability to earn more by putting in more effort. But it also means if you get sick, take a vacation, or business slows down, your paycheck does too. So while you’re earning, save aggressively. Build a cushion for the times when hours are short or opportunities shift.

** **

**Salary Pay: Stability and Commitment**

Salary pay offers consistency—you earn the same amount each paycheck regardless of hours worked. For many people, that stability brings peace of mind. You know what to expect, and you can plan your budget with confidence. Salaried positions are often tied to professional careers, which can come with more responsibilities but also more benefits.

 

If you find a company that pays well and provides a positive environment, it’s worth staying loyal. But loyalty doesn’t mean being blind. Some companies take advantage of salaried workers by overloading them with extra hours without extra pay. If you find yourself working late every night or weekends without compensation and you’re unhappy with the mission or culture, it’s time to reconsider. You owe it to yourself to find an organization that respects your time and values your contribution.

** **

**Commissions, Tips, and Bonuses: Rewarding Performance**

Some careers reward effort directly through commissions, tips, or bonuses. Sales jobs, for example, often offer commissions—extra pay based on the revenue you generate. This structure can be thrilling if you’re self-motivated, but stressful if income becomes unpredictable. The best way to thrive in commission-based work is to track your averages and build your budget around the minimum you can count on, not the maximum you hope for.

 

Tips and bonuses follow a similar idea—they reward performance or service quality. Whether you’re a server earning tips or an employee earning an annual bonus, view these as opportunities to boost your savings, not as guaranteed income. If you treat variable income as extra fuel for your long-term goals, you’ll never find yourself in trouble when business slows.

 

**Benefits Packages: The Hidden Paycheck**

When comparing job offers, never look only at the base pay. Benefits can make a huge difference in your real earnings. Health insurance, paid vacation, and retirement plans often add thousands of dollars of value each year. If your company offers a 401(k) or retirement match, always contribute the maximum they’ll match. That’s free money—and the earlier you start, the more your savings grow through compound interest.

 

Vacations, sick days, and healthcare coverage may not seem exciting when you’re young, but they protect your future. One hospital visit or unpaid week off can erase months of income if you’re unprepared. Benefits are more than perks—they’re part of your total compensation, and sometimes the best-paying job on paper isn’t the best deal overall.

** **

**Knowing When to Stay and When to Move On**

It’s tempting to think that any job is better than none, but your time is your most valuable asset. If a company underpays you, overworks you, or treats your effort as disposable, don’t settle. Start preparing your next step while you’re still employed. Build your skills, update your resume, and look for roles that offer fair pay, respect, and benefits that match your needs.

 

I’ve learned that your first job doesn’t define your career, but it can teach you what kind of work and environment you thrive in. Sometimes, staying put and growing within a good company is the right choice. Other times, moving on opens doors to new levels of income and fulfillment.

** **

**Final Thoughts: Respect Your Worth**

Whether you’re paid by the hour, through a salary, or by performance, always remember that pay isn’t just about money—it’s about respect for your effort and time. Work hard when you’re young, save early, and take advantage of every opportunity to earn extra. Learn how to read the full picture of compensation—base pay, overtime, and benefits together.

 

And if you ever feel stuck in a job that doesn’t value you, don’t let fear keep you there. You have the power to choose where and how you work. Understanding pay structures gives you the knowledge to make those choices wisely. The earlier you start managing your career like an investment, the faster you’ll build the freedom to do work that truly matters to you.

 

 

**Negotiating Your Salary and Benefits – Told by Zack Edwards**

Most people are nervous when it comes to asking for a raise or negotiating pay. But the truth is, you can’t expect anyone to pay you more than you’re willing to ask for. The key is to understand your value before you ever walk into that conversation. Start by researching what people in your position make in your area. Use websites like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Glassdoor, or PayScale to find the fair market value for your job title, experience, and region. The goal is not to guess—it’s to know the range of pay that someone with your skill set should earn. Knowledge is your first advantage.

** **

**Ear****n the Right to Negotiate**

Before you even think about asking for more money, you need to make yourself too valuable to lose. If you show up late, take shortcuts, or do the bare minimum, your boss won’t see you as an investment—they’ll see you as an expense. No one gives raises to people who drain the company’s energy. Instead, focus on becoming indispensable. Be the person who solves problems, brings in new ideas, helps coworkers, and improves results. When you make yourself a key part of the company’s success, your employer will want to keep you, and that’s when negotiation becomes possible.

 

I’ve met people who demanded more money without proving their worth, and it backfired. If you want a raise, you need to make your boss realize how much harder the company’s life would be without you. Learn new skills, take on responsibilities others avoid, and become the person who keeps things running smoothly. When you’re the one holding the team together, your value becomes clear.

** **

**The Right Way to Ask**

Negotiating doesn’t mean walking into your boss’s office and making demands. It’s about starting a professional conversation based on facts, not emotion. Begin by expressing appreciation for your job and the opportunities you’ve had. Then present your case. Show your achievements—projects you’ve led, goals you’ve met, profits you’ve helped generate, or problems you’ve solved. Back this up with your research on fair market value. The more evidence you have, the easier it is for your boss to justify your request.

 

Always speak calmly and confidently. Avoid ultimatums. Instead of saying, “I need a raise,” try, “I’ve been reviewing industry averages and the results I’ve achieved, and I believe my current salary could be adjusted to reflect that value.” That tone shows professionalism and respect while still being firm.

** **

**Leverage When Needed**

Sometimes, even when you’ve done everything right, your company may hesitate. That’s when you need leverage. If you’re truly performing at a high level and your skills are in demand, other companies will notice. There’s nothing wrong with exploring other job offers—not to leave immediately, but to understand your true value.

 

If you receive a job offer with better pay or benefits, that’s when you go back to your boss and have a serious discussion. Most employers don’t want to lose experienced workers because hiring and training someone new costs both time and money. But remember, this strategy only works if you’re actually an asset. If you’re average, they’ll let you go. If you’re exceptional, they’ll find a way to keep you.

 

When you present another offer, do it respectfully. You might say, “I’ve received another opportunity that offers a higher salary, but I enjoy working here and would prefer to stay if we can adjust my compensation.” This shows loyalty and gives your boss a reason to fight for you.

** **

**Benefits Matter Too**

A raise isn’t just about the number on your paycheck. Benefits can be just as valuable. Health insurance, paid time off, retirement contributions, tuition reimbursement, and flexible schedules all have real financial worth. If your company can’t increase your salary, consider negotiating for better benefits. You might ask for additional vacation days, a 401(k) match, or professional development opportunities. These improvements can increase your overall quality of life and long-term earning potential.

 

When I was younger, I focused only on the dollar amount. Later, I realized benefits were sometimes worth even more. If a company offers to match your 401(k), max that contribution every time—it’s free money that grows over time. Don’t overlook what’s beyond your paycheck; it’s part of your full compensation package.

** **

**The Long-Term Payoff**

Negotiating your salary isn’t just about earning a few extra dollars today—it’s about shaping your future. Every raise becomes the foundation for the next one. If you accept a lower starting salary and never renegotiate, you could miss out on thousands, even tens of thousands, over your lifetime. The earlier you learn to advocate for yourself, the more freedom you’ll build later.

 

Employers respect employees who know their worth and communicate it with professionalism. They see those people as leaders—individuals who bring confidence and stability to the team. So never fear negotiation. Prepare, prove your value, and speak with confidence.

** **

**Final Thoughts**

If you want to earn more, start by becoming someone worth more. Your work ethic, your results, and your attitude are your strongest bargaining chips. Be loyal, but don’t be afraid to explore your options. Employers respect those who stand up for their worth and back it up with performance.

 

Remember, negotiation isn’t confrontation—it’s communication. It’s about creating a win-win situation where your value and your employer’s goals align. Do your research, show your worth, and make the ask. The confidence you gain from doing that will carry through every step of your career—and that confidence, more than any paycheck, is what truly makes you unstoppable.

 

 

**Creating a Career Growth Plan – Told by Zack Edwards**

When I first started my career, I thought success was simply about working hard and waiting for opportunities to appear. I didn’t realize that success rarely just happens—it’s something you plan for. A career is like a road trip: if you don’t know where you’re going, you’ll waste time and fuel driving in circles. Creating a career growth plan gives you a map to follow, with clear goals and milestones that keep you moving toward your destination.

**Short-Term Goals: Building the Foundation**

Every career begins with a first step, and that usually means an entry-level job or a certification that gets your foot in the door. Short-term goals are the ones you can reach in the next six months to two years. These might include getting a specific credential, completing a course, or gaining experience in a starting position.

 

When I began building my own business, my short-term goals were small but clear. I wanted to create a single product that proved the concept could work. For someone starting a new career, that might mean earning your first professional certification or mastering a new skill that will make you more employable. The purpose of short-term goals is to start building momentum—to give you progress you can see and measure.

 

A good way to set short-term goals is by asking yourself, “What can I realistically accomplish next that will move me forward?” Write that down, give it a deadline, and hold yourself accountable. Once you achieve it, celebrate briefly, then set the next one.

** **

**Mid-Term Goals: Climbing the Ladder**

Once you’ve laid the groundwork, you can start planning for growth. Mid-term goals are your next big moves—the steps that turn you from a beginner into a professional. These goals usually take two to five years. They might include earning a promotion, gaining advanced certifications, finishing a degree, or taking on leadership responsibilities in your field.

 

At this stage, you start refining what you want out of your career. Ask yourself what parts of your job you love most and where you want to specialize. The mid-term phase is where you begin building your reputation and network. Seek mentors, take on challenges, and learn from people who are where you want to be.

 

When I was growing Historical Conquest, my mid-term goal wasn’t just to survive—it was to build a team that could help me expand. That meant learning how to delegate, manage projects, and communicate clearly. For you, it might mean stepping into a leadership role or switching industries to align with your passions.

** **

**Long-Term Goals: Leading or Creating**

Long-term goals are the dreams that define your purpose. They usually take five to ten years or more to achieve. These are the milestones that change your life—becoming a manager, opening your own business, completing an advanced degree, or even creating something entirely new in your field. Long-term goals give meaning to all the smaller steps you take along the way.

 

When you think about your long-term goals, focus not just on what title you want, but on the kind of person you want to become. Do you want to lead a company? Teach others? Build something that outlasts you? These goals should be ambitious but still tied to your passions. Your career is most fulfilling when your long-term vision reflects who you truly are.

 

As I grew older, I realized that entrepreneurship wasn’t just about creating a company—it was about creating opportunities for others. My long-term goal shifted from personal success to community impact. Your goals may evolve the same way, and that’s a sign of growth.

** **

**Adjusting the Plan as You Grow**

No plan is perfect, and life will always throw unexpected challenges your way. But that doesn’t mean you’ve failed—it means you need to adapt. Sometimes, an opportunity will appear that changes everything, or you’ll discover a new passion you didn’t expect. Review your career plan at least once a year and adjust it based on what you’ve learned.

 

Just like a GPS recalculates when you miss a turn, your career plan should help you find a new route when things change. The key is to stay flexible while keeping your vision in mind. The plan is there to guide you, not to trap you.

** **

**Building Habits Around Your Goals**

Goals without habits are just wishes. To reach your short-term, mid-term, and long-term milestones, you need consistent daily actions. If you want a promotion, start by showing leadership now. If you want to start a business, begin researching markets or building prototypes in your free time. If you dream of becoming a teacher, volunteer to mentor or tutor others. Every small action you take prepares you for the next opportunity.

 

Create a habit of reflection—take time each month to ask yourself what progress you’ve made and what needs improvement. Successful people don’t just plan once; they continually refine their path based on results.

** **

**Final Thoughts: Owning Your Future**

Creating a career growth plan isn’t about predicting the future—it’s about taking control of it. You can’t climb a mountain by accident; you have to choose your path, prepare your tools, and take each step with purpose.

 

Your career will have seasons of uncertainty and success, but a clear plan gives you confidence through both. Set goals that stretch you, build habits that strengthen you, and stay focused on who you want to become. The journey will change, but if you keep moving forward with direction, your career won’t just be something you do—it will become a legacy of who you are.

 

 

**Balancing Passion, Purpose, and Paycheck – Told by Zack Edwards**

When I first started working, I believed success was measured in dollars. The bigger the paycheck, the better I was doing. But over time, I learned that money alone can’t keep you fulfilled. You can have a large income and still feel empty if the work doesn’t excite you or align with what you value. True success comes when you find a balance between what you love (your passion), what matters to you (your purpose), and what sustains you financially (your paycheck). Finding that balance doesn’t happen all at once—it’s a journey built through experience, patience, and reflection.

** **

**The Early Jobs Are Your Training Ground**

Everyone has to start somewhere, and your first job won’t be perfect. It may not pay what you hoped, and it might not feel like your life’s calling. But that doesn’t mean it’s wasted time. Think of your first few jobs as training—each one teaching you new skills, habits, and lessons about what you do and don’t want in your future.

 

The average worker today changes jobs every four to five years. That means your early roles are stepping stones, not final destinations. While you’re there, focus on two things: learning and saving. Every skill you gain is an asset—something that will stay with you long after you leave that company. Every dollar you save buys you flexibility and freedom later on. Don’t pass on a good opportunity just because it doesn’t check every box. Take it, grow from it, and use it to prepare for the career that does.

** **

**Learning as a Form of Wealth**

When you’re young, your greatest resource isn’t money—it’s time. Use that time to learn everything you can. Ask questions. Volunteer for projects that stretch your limits. Observe how good leaders work, and pay attention to how businesses operate. Even if you think a certain task is beneath you, treat it like a lesson. The knowledge you gain now will become the foundation for your future success.

 

Every job gives you something—maybe not always in cash, but in experience, discipline, and perspective. Those are your hidden paychecks. If you see each position as a classroom, you’ll walk away richer every time, no matter the actual salary.

** **

**Finding the Right Balance**

Eventually, as you move through different roles, you’ll start to see what drives you. Passion is the fuel that keeps you excited to get up in the morning. Purpose gives meaning to your work—it’s the reason you care about what you do. The paycheck ensures you can sustain that passion and purpose without constant worry. The best careers find the overlap between all three.

 

You might begin with a job that’s mostly paycheck, little passion, and uncertain purpose—and that’s okay. It’s a place to start. As you gain experience, look for opportunities that bring those elements closer together. Ask yourself: Do I enjoy this work? Does it make a difference? Can I support myself doing it? The closer your answers align to “yes,” the closer you are to your ideal career.

** **

**Don’t Get Trapped by Money Alone**

I’ve met people who chased high salaries only to end up burned out and miserable. They worked hard but felt like their lives were on autopilot. They had the paycheck but no fulfillment. That’s why it’s important to recognize early that money is a tool, not a destination. It can give you freedom, but it can’t give you meaning.

 

If you love what you do but can’t pay your bills, that’s also a problem. Balance is key. You need both financial stability and emotional satisfaction to feel complete. Sometimes, that means making sacrifices—taking a job with slightly less pay for one that excites you, or sticking with a higher-paying job a little longer to build your savings before you switch. Each decision should move you closer to the life you want, even if it takes time to get there.

** **

**Saving and Planning for the Future**

While you’re figuring out your path, save as much as possible. The more you save, the more options you create for yourself. Savings give you the courage to take risks—to leave a bad job, start a new venture, or go back to school if needed. It’s not just about financial security; it’s about freedom of choice.

 

Remember, each stage of your career teaches you something new. Early on, focus on gaining experience. In the middle years, aim to balance your passion with steady income. Later, seek purpose in how your work impacts others. Your career will evolve, and your goals will evolve with it.

** **

**The Journey Toward Fulfillment**

Finding your balance between passion, purpose, and paycheck doesn’t happen overnight. It takes exploration, mistakes, and time. Every job you take, every challenge you overcome, and every lesson you learn brings you closer to that balance.

 

Don’t expect your first job to define your whole life. Expect it to shape you. Learn what motivates you, understand what you value, and build a career that allows you to live those values. When you reach the point where your work excites you, your paycheck supports you, and your purpose fulfills you—you’ll realize that true success was never about money alone. It was about building a life that matters, both to you and to the people you serve.
